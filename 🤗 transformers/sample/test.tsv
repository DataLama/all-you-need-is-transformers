NEGATIVE	I bought this item thinking it was going to protect my Garmin screen. This product almost destroyed my Garmin, The stickers that come on the cover did not come off and the GPS did not work with the cover on. I would never buy this product again nor would I recommend this product.
POSITIVE	Bjork is stubborn. She has admitted as much in many instances during her career. Although this was technically a fan-votes there is a very high probability that she left out It's Oh So Quiet and Violently Happy because they are songs which would probably have insulted her ego and her legacy. But the rest of the songs make up for this gaffe of willfullness.Heavily influenced by classical music, 11 of these tracks use orchestral instumentation of some type or another, Bjork's music is driven by her unique voice, a selection of programmed beats, and the genre of which she studied as a child.Here's to another 10 years of creativity. I wonder if there will be another Greatest Hits collection at the end of that epoch?PS: Don't buy Family Tree. While a effort that appears noble in concept, it is simply not worth the price for what is offerred.
NEGATIVE	when i looked at this product i thought that i was getting all the songs that i was told. i was completely wrong and now im stuck with a album that dont have all the songs that i wanted
NEGATIVE	"I don't know why I keep reading Patricia Cornwell's books!...Probably because I started reading from the first Kay Scarpetta book, & you can get hooked. The first Scarpetta books were excellent, the kind of books you read in one sitting. But ""Point of Origin"", in my opinion, was nothing like the other books. The ending depressed me- not that the author had to chose a happy ending. But one of the most interesting characters in the series is now dead...Apart from that, I found it boring that Cornwell uses the same villain over & over again. Even after being disappointed with this book though, I think I'll still read the next one! Old habits are hard to break."
POSITIVE	"ONE OF THE ONLY MOVIES YOU CAN WATCDH 100 TIMES A MONTH AND NOT GET TIRED OF, IT WILL STAND THE TEST OF TIME AS THE BEST ""TEEN"" MOVIE EVER MADE."
POSITIVE	This is the most entertaining book I have read in a very long time. I found myself continually reading exerpts to my friends around me because I just had the urge to share the humor. It was the kind of book that I pick up to read for only a few minutes, but end up reading it the entire way through. This book revives the senses and reminds us that even in the most dire circumstances, there is something to laugh about.
NEGATIVE	"Big disappointment. Stephanie's cars blow up, she loses handcuffs, she still hates shooting her gun, although she's a hell of a marksman in her apartment building. The whole Abruzzi plot is contrived and fizzles in the end. As does the ""GREAT RANGER SEX SCENE"" which is about as long as this review. You'd think a romance writer could have done a better sex scene, especially after building it up for seven books. Let's just say the seeming extent of Ranger's sexual prowess could be called ""Hard Ate."" Big deal. Marv Albert does that and he's no mysterious, rock-hard bounty hunter.Janet is still good at getting laughs, although much less frequently than before. She needs to put more work into character development and plot. It's time to move on from Stephanie being a stupid, but lovable, idiot.After this, I'm waiting for Nine in paperback."
POSITIVE	Husband thought it was too much for him. Hence I term it a chick flick. Kids loved it and it is suitable for children. I thought it was okay. It had moments that made you feel love, happiness, sadness. Quirky little number.
NEGATIVE	The problem is that discs 5 and 6 of season 4 would not play. I tried the discs in two different players with no success. A total of 6 episodes were unwatchable. I purchased these about 6 months before I played them and it was past the return window when I discovered the problems. I would only want to be able to replace Season 4 Discs 5 and 6. Can someone help me out here?
POSITIVE	"This is a solid book with lots of good insight from Campolo. My complaint would be that Campolo is such a great speaker, one that pours out emotion and feeling, and his writing falls short of that same intensity. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone that is advanced in their Christian reading, reading such books like 'The Divine Conspiracy', but for the less intense it is probably a good choice for ""How such I live?"" kind of reading. I'd also recommend Yancy and Manning.Campolo does a good job of putting the hard questions right out there: ""Are we doing what we should/want/dreamed of doing?"" This would be a good book for a high school or college graduate, just to remind them that ten or twenty years can blow past and one can find oneself in a fenced in yard of regret.Campolo offers a good elbow to the ribs and gives some practical advice to getting or staying on track in living ones life for Christ."
NEGATIVE	I have three children. For the first one, I bought all those curved Healthflow bottles to keep the air out of my daughter's system. Big Pain!!. They were hard to clean. I used the Playtex bottles for my two younger children. They are much easier to clean. I could even put the rings and caps in my dishwasher. I would recommend these bottles to any mother. There are a variety of nipple shapes available to experiment with. My daughter liked the natural brown ones and my son liked the rounded top in the brown and silicone varieties.
POSITIVE	Outstanding example of the way things should be done! Wonderful and helpful insight. Thank you.
POSITIVE	This product is one of the best sports socks I have ever used. It protects my foot from injuries because it has a thick layer of cushion which will also absorb all sweat if you are a jogger.The design is also very nice; it has a low anklet which doesn't appear while you are wearing your shoes.I will but two more sets in the near future.PS: Sorry for my poor English :)
POSITIVE	first of all, i want to say about that book it was really realistic.When i got this book i was expecting not good enough but the author searched of these people so much than me. I like that book and i suugest to read.
POSITIVE	A attendee brought this book to my attention at one of my seminars and suggested that I purchase a copy. The copy showed up last night and I read the first six chapters. The authors have a unique writing style that is unlike others. It is not the usual dry textbook material that puts me to sleep. Instead, they keep the reader engaged using real world examples and openly discuss the pros and cons of particular approaches. This book is good for those who want one book that explains all of the concepts you need.
POSITIVE	Bought is as a gift for someone. Am guessing that they liked it. I know I would have if it has been given to me.
POSITIVE	Voyage to the Planets and Beyond is a DVD well worth watching if you think about human travel to other planets and what the challenges would be to walk about Venus, Mars, or the moons of Jupiter or Saturn. The production demonstrates the stress of such long duration space flight would most certainly result. In fact, the human factor is quite light as compared to what will confront humans on such voyages in this century. The video is quite educational for high school and college level to understand the solar system and human spaceflight generally. I purchased it and would do so again.
POSITIVE	Mr. McMurtry is a very introspective man, and American roads are intimately connected to his soul. In these roads he sees his past, which he contrasts with the present, sometimes drawing fabulous analogies. Our roads are the rivers of the past. But my overall impression of this formidable book, is that Mr. McMurtry is sad, and even though that might not have been his motivation in writing this book, his sadness comes across very strongly. It is a good book, despite several editorial errors that should have been caught by his legendary editor.
NEGATIVE	This movie speaks for itself. It is not to be watched by claustrophobic people...Actually, it is not to be watched by any person who doesn't want to lose a hour and a half of their lives. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Or if you can't pass the Amazon Deal of the day up at such a amazing price..Buy it...But then do what the film says....Bury it....Deep so that it is never found. Complete and utter torturous to watch. And Im a Ryan Reynolds fan. I would rather take a hot staple in the eye....then have to be subjected to watching this hot mess ever again in my life. Because this system wont let me leave no stars I am unable to. But please do not mistake the forced 1 star for an actual 1 star for this film...No Stars for you Buried...None. Just Dirt....Lots of Dirt and a shovel.
NEGATIVE	We have bought three of these, and on all of them, the rock quarry doesn't work. How can this toy be still on the shelves if it doesn't work?
POSITIVE	"I just read ""It's Okay to Ask'em to Work"" and it's the most practical business book I have ever read! Every page contains something I can take away and put to immediate, practical use in the workplace.I particularly like the author's way of summarizing key points into simple,easy-to-remember maxims that help me retain the information.Some of the maxims I found most helpful: 1)Paint a Clear Picture of the Target, 2) It's Okay to Ask 'em to Work, 3) Life is Mostly Packaging, 4) Everybody Wasn't Raised at Your House, and 5) You Don't Have to be Mad to Give Corrective Feedback. (I also liked ""The Madder You Get -- the Dumber You Are! "")I wish Frank McNair would write a book on sales, or parenting for that matter!Buy this book and read it! You'll be glad you did!"
NEGATIVE	He sounds like he is kissing someone i mean he is weird i hate him. he should go to school to learn how do be a gentlemen instead of kissing 13 girls
POSITIVE	"But I ordered it anyhow.It doesn't contain any musical notes: it's a thick paperback book composed of nothing more than a couple of sentences on virtually all the ""standard"" pieces used to teach students, complete with a statement about their level. We are told, for example, that a certain March by Bach will test the student's ability to articulate, a minuet by the same composer is good for teaching the contraction of the hand. The speed at which the Fur Elise can be played, we are informed, is dictated by how fast you can play those thirty-second notes.I'm not sure how valuable this book is, although I keep it on top of my piano and refer to it frequently. After all, everything it says is stuff you already know or could easily guess if you're a teacher."
NEGATIVE	This book might be wrought with ageless wisdom, colorful history and practical horse sense- but who would know! The type is way too small (and my vision is perfect) and the text is too far into the spine. That adds up to one unpleasant reading experience-IF you can even manage the arduous task of trying to read this book. Time for a major reformatting by the publisher.
NEGATIVE	Perhaps I need to listent o it for a 5th time, perhaps I need to get my ears checked, or perhaps, to me this CD sounded like someone was torturing cats to mellow background music. Her voice sounded like draging rusty nails down a blackboard. This is my opinion however.
POSITIVE	"This is a wonderful, high quality set. My daughters and I are getting a kick out of it, once I explain that girls are not really dumb. My only issue was that it came with only 4 of the 5 discs in the set. The disc with episodes 29-32 with the bonus Donna Reed episode and interviews with ""Alice and Margaret"" is missing. I haven't contacted Amazon yet, but I am hoping they can find my 5th disc."
NEGATIVE	Shipping was horrible and package showed up damaged. The sword does not look as described in picture and info. Sword hand feels cheap and loose covering. The sword case was also cheaply made and ripped the first time that I put the sword in it carefully. I do not recommend this product!
NEGATIVE	This diaper bag was perfect, so I thought, because I am a Precious Moments collector. I received the bag and used it for a short while before it ripped at the pockets. The cheap plastic lining ripped very easily. I would not recommend it, especially for the price!
NEGATIVE	Good pics, but this camera goes through batteries like they are a penny apiece! I put in fresh new alkaline batteries and downloaded some pictures and in less than 5 minutes, the batteries were D E A D!! The batteries in my old Olympus lasted through a whole day of shooting and downloading. Also, this camera gives no warning of the batteries running low, it just shuts off. Very frustrating when you are trying to get that crucial shot. This camera is good if you are taking snapshots at home, but lousy on extended outings due to the high power consumption. Be warned, the initial price is low, but you'll quickly make up the difference on battery purchases. Rechargeable batteries? Sure, but for the extra money, you might as well get a better camera that uses alkalines conservatively. PROS: Nice Pics CON: Sucky power consumption and poorly designed power switch. My advice: Spend a few more bucks and get a good name-brand camera.
NEGATIVE	I HAS JUST GOTTEN A BRAND NEW BLUE-RAY AS A GIFT. THIS DVD WAS COMPLETELY DEFECTICE. IT HUMS, IT RADDLES, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO OPEN THE DRAWER. IT PRACTICALLY RUINED THE MACHINE.
POSITIVE	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book you could ask for on a wish list. It's exciting and supspenseful and a book I could have the joy of reading again feeling like it was the first time reading it.
NEGATIVE	"Don't be mislead by the title into thinking you were getting a ""best of"" skits. Its a documentary on the show. How it was put together, cast interactions and affairs. Not really relevant to the comedy. That's why the used price is dropping like a rock. Other people are disappointed - as I was, and getting rid of this turkey while they can still recover some of what they paid for it."
POSITIVE	I've always been a fan of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, but really this is what started it all for me! 1999, Princess Mononoke hit theaters, I was there just for fun with some friends, but this movie somehow impacted me, and then I became like the greatest fans really, I have like every movie he's done! This movie has an awesome, interesting, magical story, about a forest god and everything, action packed, oooh it's so great! ....
NEGATIVE	In addition to what David wrote above, the book has no colour photos (other than in the covers) and even the historical photos aren't that many.Most of it consists of close up shots of museum and private collection exhibits. Lack of drawings is a serious disadvantage and I still don't understand why South Lebanese Army and Ugandan tanks were not covered (they were Israeli sourced and saw combat service) when Chilean Shermans get an entire chapter. To sum up, save your money for the Lioness and Lion of the Line series and leave Gannon's book to the collectors.
NEGATIVE	do yourself a favor and do not buy it, it constantly disconected.Customers support is not availble
NEGATIVE	very disappointed in the quality of the movie.the picture was very dark, hard to see the faces clearly.everyone looked orange with dark shadows on faces i will not be ordering any more videos -national lampoons christmas
NEGATIVE	I have 2 of these dead on my desk right now. We installed dozens of linksys unmanaged switches and are seeing almost 100% failure within 1 year.Spend the extra money for something that has a better warranty like the HP Procurve series.z
POSITIVE	My 5 yo got this from Santa as her big gift. I'm not sure what problems another reviewer is having in terms of closing the castle, but as long as you remove the toys from the center area, it pushes down just fine. There is a little motor noise when the castle is raising up, but that is to be expected. I think the quality of the castle is very good. My daughter loves it and the two playrooms, (dining/bedroom) that go with it (but must be purchased separately.) I'm not sure if I would have spent $60 on it, but Santa found it for half that price prior to Christmas. I would definitely purchase this again.
NEGATIVE	"I got these after breaking a pair of Sharper Image noise-cancelling headphones, thinking that Sennheiser would be a good replacement, noise-cancelling or not. Not really. I used them just one day, trying them with digitally remastered music, even music mixed in *5.1 Surround Sound*, and there was just no boom from the bass, like was promised on the packaging. At a higher volume, the music is slightly more quality, but the music still lacked substance to me.There was this, and there was the fact that the leatherette around the edge of each of the earpieces gave me discomfort because the phones concealed my ears completely but not my lobes, and it felt almost like blood got cut off at that part. For this and the above reason I am sending these things back.In all, don't get these if you want wraparound headphones and you think ""Sennheiser = Class."" I suppose these would be more suitable as DJ headphones, but I do not know."
POSITIVE	I got this headset for my laptob but i wanted to use it on my ps3! so i bought a converter to usb and it woeks great!
POSITIVE	Steve Vai did a excellent job with this album. Most instrumental albums are just showcases for the musician to show his chops, but in this case Vai wrote the music wonderfully. This is an enjoyable album for non-guitar fans too. All the notes are played with feeling and emotion. There is also a two great tribute songs, FRANK which is a tribute to the late Frank Zappa is a beutiful ballad. Then JIBBOOM which is a song inspire from SCUTTLE BUTTIN by STEVIE RAY VAUGHN. Windows to the soul is a masterpiece which I thought was the best song of 1999. Steve Vai is a combination of technique, emotion, and creativity.
POSITIVE	Before vampires sparkled you had truly entertaining stories. Lestat is on a mission to out vampires to the world and in his doing so meets the true vampire queen Akasha. Great acting, okay story line but NOTHING like the book. If you take it on its own you will be able to enjoy it.
NEGATIVE	okay so my cousin and I watched this movie and I was amazed at how stupid it was there are one or two good parts but really nothing else the good scenes are the one at the end at fort knox and the begining where he blows up the building althouth it did get a high rating by critics.
NEGATIVE	"Not a bad story, but readers should know up front that this is a book primarily about the paranormal, and not a cozy mystery as the name of the book might lead one to believe.Also, while the author obviously wants to make points about how a divorced mother needs to approach dating, the misgivings that the protagonist has toward her suitor -- while furthering the understanding that the protagonist is a woman who always puts her kids first -- has the (I hope) unintended side effect of making the reader feel like the suitor is creepy. In a book where good and evil are so clearly delineated, it's unfortunate that one of the main characters comes off as ominous and naggingly ""there's something not right about this guy."""
NEGATIVE	I was very upset That some of the dialog was cut from the directors edition and also the computers voice in the background. I thought it made it sound more like what life really would be like on a starship. I wish they would just release a copy of the original cut of the movie. Most of the rework on this really didn't make much of a difference. I guess I'll be forced to buy a foriegn VCD copy in order to get the original cut. Not worth the wait or the hype.
NEGATIVE	I purchased both a 55cm and a 65cm Go Fit Ultimate Burst Resistant Core Stability Ball for personal use. So far I am very dissapointed with it as they lose air and are not round. You try to roll them and they are very lopsided. Would not purchase this brand again. Very disappointed with it.
NEGATIVE	Harvest moon is a great game, and I especially like this one. The con is where it freezes, and all your work is taken from you. Time after time I tried over and over, and even saved it on both files. My time was used playing this game and now it's wasted.
NEGATIVE	the cover is the best project. there is not enough information or project for pre fab projects. and too general information. you can get those information in any architectural magazine.
NEGATIVE	If you're looking for a double-sided roll of velcro like I was-BEWARE! As others have described in the reviews of this product, the unit I received was FUZZY-SIDE ONLY; i.e., it was completely useless as a cable tie. Consider purchasing another similar item to save yourself the time and trouble of having to return this item for a refund.
NEGATIVE	I purchased this for my 8 year old for Christmas and thought I would be able to store more than just a few songs, but the memory capacity is actually only 109M and will actually only hold about 8-10 songs, no where near the 2 hours promised. I would not recommend this purhcase to any child.
NEGATIVE	"Though I am new to Excel and VB, I have several years of experience in spreadsheet automation with another spreadsheet product and macro language. This book certainly provides a wealth of information but it is my opinion that the text is difficult to follow by those inexperienced in visual basic. As a VB beginner, I wouldn't recommend this book unless you have a lot of time to dedicate to your learning experience. Lessons 1 and 2 started off on the right track and were easy to understand. Unfortunately, I felt that the lessons that followed jumped into VB too fast and furious. Explanations such as ""If you assign a range object to a variable, you can use that variable as an object to the range property"" were common and did not provide me with a clear understanding of the issue. Good book for experienced and/or advanced users. In my opinion, beginners should stay away and opt for a more introductory text. Thank you."
POSITIVE	This one definitely fights off the cheese! The sounds are believable, spooky, and well-produced. Additionally, the one-long-track format is perfect for looping during Trick-or-Treat or an outdoor haunt. While some may find the repetetiveness of the various sounds detrimental, I thought it worked fine! This is because it allows you to pack the punch of an assortment of sounds over short periods of time, without the pressure of having to cater to a specific timeline or story that short-term visitors won't be able to appreciate. Hallowe'en makes us totally subject to en masse memory rushes, and so it's probably a good thing that this mix is dense!
POSITIVE	My favourite character is Uncle Griffinskitch because he seems so mysterious and smart. I really like the way the Troooguls look because they are ugly, but fascinating. I think Captain Jinx is really creative because you would never think a grasshopper would be tough and strong, but she is.
POSITIVE	Many freeze dried foods contain additives that are not particularly healthy. This one is surprisingly free of the most common unhealthy additives, and it tastes OK which is about all you can hope for.Chicken TeriyakiINGREDIENTS: Chicken Teriyaki: Cooked Chicken, Soy Sauce (wheat, soybeans, salt), Brown Sugar, Bamboo Shoots, Mushrooms, Red Peppers, Green Peas (peas, salt), Modified Corn Starch, Sherry Wine (contains sulfite), Onions, Green Peppers, Garlic Powder, Alcohol, Ground Ginger, Salt, Vinegar, Lactic Acid. Rice: Precooked Enriched Rice (enriched with niacin, iron [ferric orthophosphate], thiamine mononitrate, folic acid). CONTAINS: Soy, Wheat
NEGATIVE	I gave it a quick look over, it's a weak case for Jesus, when it is even mentioning him. If you want positive evidence for the existence of Yeshua Ben Yosef, I suggest you get something else, or just do a search on the net, the information will be much better than what is contained within this book. Even if you're looking for just general apologetics, I strongly suggest getting another book, one without pictures each chapter.This book is crap, plain and simple. The only thing I can recommend it for is to make Christians look stupid. Anyone could read it, and write a rebuttal in a single day.Is it any wonder why I am the first to review it?
POSITIVE	I found this book to be amazing, as all her books! Any book with Acheron, Nick and the DH I will be buying as soon as it hits the shelf!
NEGATIVE	"On the plus side: I've had no problems ripping / downloading songs and it's great for text messaging. It's got a SIM-card which I think is different from (and better than) most US phones.On the down side: 1) the keys aren't backlit so you can't use in the dark. 2) the earphones are horrible: they're heavy, don't have a clip, have bizarrely long ear wires, and can't be ""coiled up"" when not in use (so mine are always tangled). They're impossible to use while jogging. They come disconnected from the phone if you leave it in your pocket. Finally, the mic sits about belt level, which is why you always see people holding their ""hands free microphone"" if they want to be heard. It's hard to imagine how the same company could make this cool phone & these horrible mic/headphones.In short: Fine for on the train, but not for active usage."
POSITIVE	The Dnward spiral is one of the best things that has happened to me
POSITIVE	I really enjoyed this book a lot, but I just wish that the ending would have better. You really get wrapped up in the story-line and as you are nearing the end of the book you find yourself truly hoping that Gilthanas finds Silvara. But once you reach the last page you realize that the story ends right where it began. On the upside though, the plot is excellent and the appendix of this book proves valuabe to anyone who is role-playing using the Fifth Age Rules. Overall, a great book, I can hardly wait for the continuation!
NEGATIVE	I am surely a Shakespeare fan but want to consciously decide to watch a Shakespearean production. Here, I thought I was watching a drama-filled action movie...hardly. Gets a 1 for hiding the reality of the director's direction.
POSITIVE	EVen more than buying the CD, ya wanna see this guy live. He's been playing in NYC for a while, and i've caught a few of his shows. He is one of the most electrifying performers i've seen. He is a band by himself--playing guitar and also using it as percussion, blowing through his lips to play trombone..i know it sounds somewhat lame, BUT he pulls it off, even for this cynical concert-going New Yorker. I say get the CD, and do your best to catch his show whenever he's in your town.
NEGATIVE	The picture and on-line menu features are great but it skipped so much I had to return it in 3 weeks. It actually skipped 10 minute segments of the movie. At first I thought it was a bad scene transition in the movie. The only way I could see some of the missed scenes is by rewinding over the skipped section.
POSITIVE	"If you've never read a book on organizing before, this is a great one. BUT, if you have, even though the book claims to have a fresh, new approach, you'll see some of the same old techniques used here. Good for review, and her SPACE technique is a handy way to remember the order in which to organize anything. But I lost interest half way through the book, thinking it was the ""same old, same old."" STILL, if you've never read a book on organizing before, this one is probably one of the best."
POSITIVE	"Michael Levine is a former DEA agent who, throughout the 1980's, worked to uncover, expose and convict many of the leading suppliers of cocaine to the United States. Unfortunately for Levine, many of the most powerful cocaine dealers proved to be CIA assets, supported and even bankrolled by the American government in pursuit of shadowy foreign policy objectives. Levine's diligence in fighting the so-called ""drugs war"" brought him the ruination of his reputation within the DEA and ultimately the destruction of his career. The cynicism that Levine exposes within the highest levels of American government is breathtaking - and profoundly depressing."
NEGATIVE	I feel the interpretations here lack the depth found in Leonard Cohen's interpretations. These songs sound like yet-another-song from these singers. If that's what you're looking for then okay, but it's definitely not something I would buy.And I find Leonard Cohen's voice quite interesting, as opposed to what the critics say on this page. I don't like all of his songs, though (esp. not the recent ones).
POSITIVE	Este DVD es excelente, una comedia para no perdersela, las notas y todos los agregados son espectaculares.
POSITIVE	I've ordered this twice, once where I had to contact customer service to get the case sent instead of a single package (which they accomplished very quickly) and a second time where they got it right the first time. What ever problem they had seems to have been resolved. This is a great deal if you use these a lot.
POSITIVE	"If anything, my daughter loves this DVD a bit too much. She picks up the box, runs to the couch, points at the TV and says ""Elmo! Elmo! Elmo! Elmo!"" until I either give in or hide. We don't let her watch much TV, so this has basically become the only TV we watch with her. On the bright side - it is very well done, the songs are good, there are plenty of variations on the alphabet song, and they really do focus on teaching the alphabet. If she has to watch something, I feel like this is at least educational. Maybe it's because I grew up with Sesame Street, but compared to a lot of modern kid's shows, I also find it very watchable. I'm not as enthused about watching it 5X/week as my daughter is, but it's definitely bearable for the adults."
NEGATIVE	The who's who of comedy fail dismally to deliver in this dvd. So they were still young and raw, but the bottom line is that I did not have more than 3 laughs throughout the movie. I have seen these guys bring on the laughs in later performances. They will themselves look back at this and consider it a learning curve on how not to do comedy.
NEGATIVE	This game looked good when in all truth it is a mediocre game. The levels where allright and the game was WAY TO SHORT it did not take me very long at all before I got to the end. Which really sucked by the way. The multiplayer is allright that's probably the best feature of the entire game. I have not tried the Online so I do not know if that is worth buying the game for 49.99$ The game really is probably a 2.5 I hoped this helped you I wish I would of read a review that would of told more of the TRUTH about the game..!!
POSITIVE	"""The Helen Morgan Story"" is one of those great older movies that they just don't make anymore. The stars are beautiful (Ann Blyth & Paul Newman), the acting is wonderful, the music is great...it is a wonderful movie depicting the life of a musical great. Why they didn't use Ann Blyth's voice is beyond me though. They thought someone with a beautiful voice like hers couldn't sing torch songs? Paul Newman is great as Helen Morgan's lover. I was a kid but I still DO remember the original Playhouse 90 broadcast with singer Polly Bergen portraying Helen Morgan, who was also wonderful. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good acting and good music, because that's what you'll get when you watch ""The Helen Morgan Story""."
POSITIVE	I was looking at some stores for an Apple iPod a few weeks ago. I stumbled upon this 20 Gigabyte one that caught my attention. It was only $299.99 which is only fifty bucks more than the iPod mini which only holds 1,000 songs. This iPod holds 5,000 songs and is a very good deal. Sony's Mini Disc Players are good too, but they just don't stand up to the iPod. The outside has a sleek white coating which looks high-tech. The back is metal but the only bad thing is when you put your fingerprints on it it sticks to the iPod which can be seen easily. You should buy a case if that happens. They have really nice see through cases that fit snuggly on it. I'm recommending this for any one who reads this but if you have children it's almost Christmas time and they might be wanting to get this!
NEGATIVE	"The unGodly amount of material in Hollywood is the only reason readers unfortunately exist. A better use of your money might be to purchase 3 or 4 of your favorite screenplays and read them. Look how they are written and use that format. Buy a couple text books on writing for general guidelines. Then take your money and start hitting the streets meeting people. You're best bet is to have an ""in"" at the place youre pitching your material.Is it a bad book? No. Is it a must have? Absolutely not. A few good pointers, but alot of self-centered, self-important tips that won't make or break your deal. If you have an original idea or a new twist, that may be enough. The best bet is to take that original idea (if there are any left)and punch out a good screenplay. Do your homework, get good honest feedback and don't give up."
POSITIVE	I have had such pain in my knees. This product is wonderful! I can tell the days I forget to take it.
NEGATIVE	Despues de seguir la carrera, del poeta urbano, me duele admitir que esta recopilacion de exitos, es de baja calidad. Ojala y no sea que el animal nocturno, puso su fuego de libertad en refrijeradora. De un amigo! eMarco~~{~(@
POSITIVE	"You Chumps that complain about what is or isn't on a compilation are pathetic. If you really like the Stones then you already have everything good. If you rely on someone else to tell you what's worth having or important, then you're just a sucker that's ripe for the taking. Buy, borrow or steal the original whole albums(remastered) 'cause there's ALWAYS great stuff on 'em that doesn't make the ""greatest"" hits or box sets. I give this 4 stars for the songs but leave one off for thinking we fans even need this contrived concoction. Seriously, it's like talking to children..."
NEGATIVE	My wife reads aloud to me by the fire. We have enjoyed other Jill Churchill books, so we were looking forward to this one. My Goodness what a mess! The plot was hap-hazard and undeveloped. The characters, humor and mystery were all non-existent. The pages were full of careless, unedited typographical errors, misspelling, and gramatical disasters. Words were left out of sentences and sentences trailed off without an ending. The conclusion of the book was a relief. What a shame! Maybe Jill Churchill had a deadline she could not meet. Maybe her publisher did not print it correctly. Maybe it was just a mess.
POSITIVE	I love ordering from Amazon. I always have great results, and this transaction continued the trend!
POSITIVE	Just awesome movies! Dark knight rises was worth the money by itself. Now just for the next batman on blu-ray
NEGATIVE	I replaced my old mouse with this thing. It does sand wood, but the vacuum port does not fit either of my standard vacuums. The bag collects some dust but the motor cooling fan blows stray dust all over the shop like a hurricane! Had a few loose small items on the bench and some plane shavings etc. and the wind from the motor fan did a nice job of clearing off the bench! So the dust collection feature is nothing but a joke. I'll return this unit and go back to my old mouse thank you very much. Don't waste your time carrying this thing home if you need a dust collecting sander!
POSITIVE	"I don't know if I would call this a ""large fountain pump"". I bought it for our fountain which is a medium fountain with a 4 foot lift height. The pump arrived and it looked kind of small, I was skeptical. It does work, and certainly for $23 it's worth it. Even if it only lasts a couple of years its worth it. I had a much larger pump, that this Sunterra pump replaced, which moved more water than this little one and it failed after 2.5 years (warranty 1 year). It was three times the price. The flow is a little weak for a 4 foot lift height, but it is adequate, and if it keeps working the way it does now, I would be happy with it."
NEGATIVE	It is really not worth the money. As a workout, the three levels of workouts are not aerobic enough and too repetitive. As a Ballet class, the moves are too simple and there are a lot of other options.
POSITIVE	Marina V. is now one of my favorite artists. She is an amazing songwriter and her voice is calming and full of emotion. This CD continues to play in my car and on my computer and I hope she doesn't wait too long before coming out with another!
POSITIVE	"I was determined to find some gay Christmas stories this year and happily came upon ""All I Want For Christmas,"" four short stories written by some of today's best authors of the genre. The winner here was ""An Extra Large Christmas"" by Chris Kenry. It was a totally heart-warming piece, I especially liked it as it just wasn't typical. I don't want to spoil the story for you, but I love that Kenry had a hunky guy falling for someone (the UPS man) who did not exactly fit the gay stereotype. Michael Mann who is among my favorite authors offers a very appealing story here with ""If You Believe."" The other two stories were enjoyable but not as outstanding as the two I have already mentioned. A great book to cuddle up with in front of the fire, I highly recommend it!Guy De RosaLos Angeles, California"
POSITIVE	Have not tested every port yet but so far, I really like it! Good idea to include something to hang it with--since this product assumes odd positions and looks like a patient on life support with all those plugs in it! (But many items have short USB cables, so we are wondering just where we would hang it!) In spite of our amusement, I think it is the most attractive hub out there. Some folks think the blue light is a tad too bright but I like it and since I added an energy saver surge protector that turns everything off when my PC shuts down, all is well.
POSITIVE	Pros:Lights up the page perfectly and evenlyDoesn't get hotBulbs don't seem to ever burn outKeeps light confined to page, thus being less disturbing anyone near by who may be trying to sleepCons:Plastic scratches rather easily, however the scratches aren't really noticeable when reading, only when holding the item up to a light.Verdict: Buy it if you want a light, convenient and reliable booklight.
NEGATIVE	I've been into harissa for the last 2 years after reading about it in a recipe and been hooked since. Recently purchased this one because of the great price but that should've told me something. After receiving it I used in on a rice dish and I was disappointed in the flavor, oiliness and paste like constancy. I looked at the ingredients and the first thing listed was VEGETABLES???? I've learned that the main ingredient in harissa should be 'red chili peppers' not vegetables! I learned vegetables are used as a filler to make more product. Not buying this product ever again.
NEGATIVE	Apparently a used book with some writing on the face page that had been scratched out and the spine was broken. I wish I would have had Barnes & Noble order the book. Because of this bad experience I probably will not be ordering books again.
POSITIVE	Before you find yourself swayed by the words of the past reviewers who seemed to have recieved a narcissistic orgasm out of slamming the hell out of this book, I suggest you go to the bookstore, pick up a copy and read a chapter. If you have ever worked retail, especially music, books, or movies, turn immediately to the chapter on the Cultured Proletariat. If you say you've never participated in this rebellious shadow economy, then I say you're a liar. Read it and recognize yourself, but don't laugh out loud...your boss might be watching. Also, Mr. and Mizz Bohemia out there, relax. Don't be so critical when someone actually offers an autobiographical glimpse into those more wild times of thier lives. Many of the past reviewers are not able to see past the one crime Powers committed: she got on with her life and is able to look back and examine the temporal context in which she lived....
NEGATIVE	Much like other recent reviews, I had a problem with my Drinkwell leaking water everywhere. I was especially disappointed because I had the same model for about 5 years - I loved it and bought a replacement model.This company may have fallen prey to shrinking margins and Quality Assurance departments. As others have noted, the unit appears to leak continuously from the point where the motor is supposed to form a seal with the machine.The worst of it is, my cats are now scared of drinking, because of all the puddles they walked into. This device was supposed to alleviate the problem of my cats not drinking enough water, but they actually made it much worse.
POSITIVE	Ever since these two concerti were first recorded, I have considered them to be the ultimate expression of these pieces. The Grieg has never been surpassed by anyone in my opinion. While one might quibble about the interpretation of the Schumann, it stands well above any other competition.
NEGATIVE	TM3 i must say was quite dissapointing. The main reason for this is beacuse the characters...There were three good characters in the whole game, the rest were poo piles. Also, the levels were too small, and there wasn't a lot to blow up. In TM 2, one of my fav things was taking down the eiffel tower w/ a remote. That was sweet, especially if an enemy was residing in the tower at the time. You just can not do that in TM 3. The graphics also, were worse than 2. I just do not understand how you can make a 2nd sequel to a great series and have worse graphics than before. But of course, 989 studios, the ones responsible for the absolutley horrific graphics of the psx nba shoot out series, were behind this game. The only good thing i can say about this game is that it is a tad better than the first and that it can become a little addicting, as each game of the series can. All in all, the best for psx in TM2, dont waste your money on #3.
POSITIVE	Mixed with water and sprayed on the foundation of our house (inside and out). Really stopped the annual migration of spiders and millipedes into our home, and it's pet friendly!
NEGATIVE	My five year old loves Superman and got this for his birthday. After about two minutes it was spread all over the house and in my youngest son's hair. It took 1/2 an hour in the tub and 10 minutes to comb the stuff out of my son's hair. It is even extremely difficult to get off of your hands. It was a mess and I can't see why this is marketed to ages 4+.
NEGATIVE	This book was awful - I knew who the killer was by the time Igot through a quarter of the book. It was choppy writing andelementary at best. I couldn't concentrate on it because it was so boring and found myself wondering how many more pages were left until the torture would end. Too bad someone didn't kill this BOOK off. ew yuck, don't bother.And I'm actually a fan of MHC.
NEGATIVE	Heaven help us in the arts if anyone thinks this book is useful for creating works of art. One of the projects uses foil as an armiture and then covers it with pariscraft gauze. I found this to be a very poor guide for creating sculpture, and an inforcement of the worst of what sculpture can be. There was some useful information here and there for the beginner, but not enough to make it worth the price of the book.
NEGATIVE	"This Bible is a great references book, however I did not receive all pages that was listed in the table of contents. The chapter that is missinG is ""160 All Time Favorite Bible Passages"" (1301) frist book was returnand repleacement order was the same as the frist. You need to inspect your stock before shipping a repleacement order.ThanksMelvin Truiett, Sr."
NEGATIVE	I'm really not terribly happy with the product. I had been using Palmer's Tummy Butter (half the price at Walmart) and decided to try this instead and have been disappointed. It's super greasy, I find the smell a bit chemically and unpleasantly floral, and more than anything, it really doesn't have much staying power. Pros: less itching. I really do prefer Palmer's for the price and the quality.
POSITIVE	This book was an excellent read. It is not a book that is easily read, or that can be read in a hurry, but rather engages the reader to think and learn each character. I really liked how different characters were introduced throughout the book, even though it was a hostage situation and all characters were present, but not acknowledged until the twist of their character came forward. This is one of the few books I will read again. I had not thought about this until reading another review where it suggested that the ending was eluded to throughout the book.It was heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time.
NEGATIVE	"These sheets are very nice looking and quite soft. HOWEVER, on first wash, they got all ""pilly"" and look like I've had them for years, not one day. They still feel nice, they just don't look as nice as they should. If you plan NEVER to wash them, they're perfect!"
POSITIVE	WHEN SOMEONE SAYS IT IS NOT TIVOLI, LIKE THE ONE REVIEW LISTED HERE, I JUST SKIP IT AND FEEL SORYY THAT HE WOULD THINK THIS RAIDIO, WOULD SOUND LIKE A $100+ DOLLAR RADIO.LISTEN UP, THIS RADIO EXCEEDS ANYTHING FOR THE PRICE, I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TUNE IN EVERY LOCAL FM, AND AM, WITH NO PROBLEM.ON FM THIS RADIO SOUNDS SMOOTH, CLEAR,PLEASANT, IT DOES NOT SOUND TINY, LIKE RADIO'S I HAVE LISTENED TO AT THE $50- 60 RANGE. JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF AUTO BASS, THIS MEANS THIS RADIO IS VERY COMFORTABLE TO LISTEN TO FOR LONG PERIODS.I GIVE TI 5 STARS, BEACUSE, THIS TIME, YOU ARE GETTING MUCH MORE FOR YOUR MONEY, HOW OFTEN DOES THIS HAPPEN?BUY THIS RADIO, BUY IT EVEN IF YOU DO NOT NEED IT, AT LEASET EXPERIENCE BUYING SOMETHING, WHEN YOU OPEN THE BOXE AND LOOK AT THE QUALITY AND SHARP DESIGN, YOU WILL THINK THE MADE A MISTAKE.NO MISTAKE, ON OF THE BEST BARGAINS AROUD, WHAT A GERAT XMAS GIFT, THEY WILL THINK YOU SPENT A BUNDLE ON THIS GIFT.
POSITIVE	I have had several of these irons. I like them because they are heavy and don't automatically turn off. This iron is really nice for basic ironing; however, I have decided they don't work real well when quilting. Sometimes, when pressing small pieces, the fabric gets caught in a steam hole and gets scrunched up, then you have to iron like mad to get it flat again--which may cause distorting of the fabric. All in all, I would get this iron--it used to be made by GE ages ago--it is a workhorse.
POSITIVE	Mr. lamb offers an honest unbiased critique of the Arab countries. His remarks consist of very complimentary remarks and very critical comments. Both are honest with reasoning put forth with them. I highly recommend this book.
NEGATIVE	I had colorforms when I was a kid back in the 60s, and I thought it would be perfect for my three-year-old. Unfortunately, the stickers didn't stick--not at all.My wife and I thought this was a fluke and bought a different Colorforms--Dora the Explorer--and the pieces in that box also didn't stick.How does the maker of Colorforms--University Games Corporation--stay in business?
POSITIVE	I found this book at the library and I just fell in love with it. It is so cute and sweet and the pictures are just gorgeous! It perfectly demonstrates the wonderful relationship that people can have with cats if they will just treat them right. As the boy learned, if you are gentle and kind to cats, you will be rewarded with the affection of very loving creatures. My cat is just like that. Mark Graham's beautiful paintings illustrate the wonderful qualities of cats: they are mysterious, beautiful, serene, cozy, and very affectionate. This book is out of print, but I have been fortunate enough to find two old copies. I treasure them.
POSITIVE	I ordered this on a Saturday and had it by Wednesday. It was a gift for a friend who needed it to fulfill his collection. He and I were VERY PLEASED. And all for around $6.00 US. How could you possibly go wrong.
POSITIVE	I am a professional athlete and I use this back buddy all the time. I can't just get a massage every day of the week, so I purchased this recently remembering when I saw one of my buddies using it a few years ago. It is great and a sturdy product. I have been very pleased and would recommend to anyone with upper back knots frequently. Also very durable as well. I am 275lbs and I really come down hard on this back buddy and it withstands the test.
NEGATIVE	Let me just say that my mom rented this movie for a project in college (Shes out of college now, thank god). ANYWAY, she rented this movie and i thought i would watch it since i love horror movies ( i own friday the 13th, the exorcist, halloween, ect...) and this movie is pure CRAP. I watched this expecting to be scared or atleast entertained. WRONG. It bored me to death if anything. It just has a bunch of teenagers running around cussing and you cant see anything its so dark. Peewee's Big Adventure is a masterpiece compared to this film.
NEGATIVE	I am extremely frustrated with this camera. Its backup feature is not working in Vista Home Premium. It seems the camera software is not recognizing the firewire connection ( 4pin to 4pin) to the laptop. What good does it make if I can not save the videos !!!!
NEGATIVE	"Why is the very first thing they teach you is ""I speak Norwegian"". After learning that, you can't speak another word. Should start with ""where is the bathroom"" or something useful. I would prefer a text to go with it to help with the pronunciation. It is difficult to fine tune the exact sound. Maybe I need a better sound system , but I had a lot of difficulty with it."
POSITIVE	If your a fan of the black and white mysteries of the 30's and 40's, like Charlie Chan and Sherlock Holmes, you will want to add the Mr. Moto series to your collection. I just watched them for the first time, and enjoyed all of them.
NEGATIVE	This is a versatile appliance but since I purchased it to cook small amounts of rice, it's a bit of a disappointment. Everytime I steam rice, lots of water overflows onto the counter top. I am afraid that it will reach another appliance and electrocute someone or start a fire. According to the instructions, you're to add water to the bowl of rice itself, but it seems to be too much for the steamer to handle. The rice comes out perfect, but I think this will be my last time using it for that purpose. It sometimes overflows [from the base] when steaming other foods for a long time, so it's not always just the rice. Don't buy this steamer. Nice concept, not so smart design.
POSITIVE	"I found the book to be very intriguing, although at times it seemed to ""always have the answer"" to certain historical mysteries, sometimes that got a little pretentious but....I was engrossed and did read it in short order.I do recommend the book!"
POSITIVE	slug is 1 lyrically talented mofo, he isnt tryin to be no gangsta iether, i respect that
NEGATIVE	My 12 month old son got this toy as a gift,one day he was sitting on it and I heard a snap, he somehow snapped off one side of the handle bar's. I could not believe my young son could be capable of that.
POSITIVE	I think that Mitzi Kapture is really good in this movie and it proves women can be strong and protect men instead of a man protecting a women
NEGATIVE	I bought these to replace a box I purchased years ago at an office supply store for use in my workshop. Because I can't find a good electric pencil sharpener that cuts a 30 degree point (most cut a much longer 23 degree point), I found using each short pencil until it wasn't sharp enough anymore to be both cost and time effective.I purchased this box of pencils expecting them to be like my old box. Not so. These pencils are all poorly sharpened. The tips are so dull that they aren't usable for marking woodworking dimensions.
POSITIVE	"... this is from a ""Welcome"" text file on the root of the disc, and it describes what's on it perfectly.""Thank you for pre-ordering Tribes(R): Vengeance!Included on this disc are two maps for Tribes(R): Vengeance, the Starsiege(TM): Tribes game, and a game trailer and demo for the upcoming game Ground Control II(R): Operation Exodus.""For $1, you can't really go wrong."
NEGATIVE	I purchased this book as I thought it was appropriate due to my child's age. However, I realized that I should have bought the very first one. I read this anyway. I found it quite hilarious! While I can appreciate that Ezzo perceives that he is accurate, I find that it is assanine that someone truely believes that in order for a baby to sleep better they need to feel that their parent's marriage is secure! I picked and chose the information that I felt was accurate and went from there. I wouldn't recommend this book alone. I would recommend this book in tandem with Sleeping Through the Night, Revised Edition: How Infants, Toddlers, and Their Parents Can Get a Good Night's Sleep by Jodi A. Mindell who takes a scientific approach versus her experience.
NEGATIVE	Nice music, nothing extraordinary. Video is a slide show of photographs. Nice, but appear to be pictures within an aquarium. My opinion, not worth the price.
NEGATIVE	"I purchased this router to increase the range compared to my 4 year old Belkin g router. After setting it up and talking to tech support for 2 hours, I still get the exact same signal (very low) as I did with the old g-class router. I am using an Asus netbook with an n wireless adaptor, but the DIR 655 performs exactly the same as an old g router from about 40 feet away. 6x? 14X? ""extreme-n""?. The exact same performance as a g-class router, the only difference is that the DIR 655 is more expensive."
NEGATIVE	"I bought this book when my son was 18 months old. He is now 3 1/2 years old and has never even wanted to try any of the recipes I made using this book. The recipes are complicated and time consuming (not what you want when you are trying to look after a toddler) and too full of undisguised ""weird"" ingredients that fussy eaters won't even touch. I think it would only be useful for parents whose children are non-picky eaters from the start."
NEGATIVE	never again! What a horrible experience. The seller of this toy is one of the nastiest most vile business people I have come across. I can't believe Amazon does business with them. I am sure they will not be for long. My son was happy with toy; it's the seller that is no good.
NEGATIVE	Absolutely beautiful woman with a top notch make-up artist and minimal talent. How she has gotten as far as she has is a mystery to me....
NEGATIVE	I tried this model for a long time. The blade consistantly veared off to one side cutting the pill 75% - 25% with the 25% side be crushed to poweder. i would give less than 1 star if i could.
NEGATIVE	Do not waste your money on this product!! Whilst Amazon has a very good price for it, the headset is junk! I tried two different sets and both had a terrible hum. The hum was audible at all jacks in the house and on two different phone lines. It could be heard by the other party and made my hearing the other party nearly impossible. I work for the phone company and have used headsets over the past 25 years with no problmes. This set is very poor quality and not worth the money.
POSITIVE	This book is a must for any dog owner. Ms. Mcconnell writes the way she talks (I've heard her radio show for many years); clearly, with a great sense of humor and loaded with helpful hints. She explains how dogs think and compares it to how humans think. She shows where we miscommunicate with our pets and in that way also shows us how to communicate better so our pets can do what we really want them too. I highly recommend this book.
POSITIVE	Other than his virtuosity as a lyric tenor, Placido exhibits at large his innate attributes of Spanish singer; surely the mark of his parents Placido and Pepita Embil both zarzuela singers. The adorable presence and voice of Ana Maria Martínez, so natural and versatile in her expression, and with those sweet and clean altos, make of her the perfect mate to Placido in this style. The conductor López-Cobos succeeds in drawing the spirit and rythm of zarzuela from the fine Mozarteum Orchestra. Though I missed some emblematic zarzuelas like Los Gavilanes and La Leyenda del Beso, this DVD is the most enjoyable fiesta madrileña.
POSITIVE	These work very well, but be really careful when using them. Do not:Drop ice in the glass -1 glassJam your hand in to wash -1 glassOther than that, they will keep cold drinks really cold. You ice cubes don't melt for a long time.
POSITIVE	This works in my car very well, I almost forget that it is not part of my car's sound system. I went on a trip recently and only had to search for another blank station one time.
NEGATIVE	"What a hapless piece of trash. ""Lady Gaga: One Sequin at a Time"" provides a rudimentary once-over of Lady Gaga's childhood and the beginning of her career, all the way to (vaguely) the release of The Fame Monster. The filmmakers essentially read her entry on the Simple English Wikipedia, and merely cloaked it in an hour of out-of-context interviews, footage of Gaga walking red carpets or getting out of cars, and some random, very angry British man. Worst of all? They couldn't afford the rights to her music, so instead they opened up GarageBand and created generic electronica tracks that sound just enough like Just Dance and Poker Face to be recognizable, but just off enough to avoid paying royalties. Around when we heard ""Ma Ma Ma Mao"" was I certain that this was the worst thing to play on my TV in a while."
NEGATIVE	"The author continues to cover the same ground on how good Tai Chi is for one medically. After about the 10th time it becomes over kill. I haven't finished the book as I'm turned off by the lack of information that is true information on how to practice Tai Chi, look for a teacher, etc. As I have now found a true Tai Chi teacher, I realize how poor this book really is. This is the authors own style and does not necessarily reflect the main Tai Chi styles taught. If you're looking for a book on ""real"" Tai Chi, this isn't it."
NEGATIVE	"This book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy. Save your cash and get it from the library. Then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman, not a child taking orders or information without question. If you want to go through pregnancy, labor and birth, and have no say at all or learn anything useful, then stick with this book; i.e., go to the hospital, have an epidural, episiotomy, then finally the c-section that 'must' have been necessary, this is it.Beyond that, read Ina May Gaskins, Henci Goer, the Sears' books, and ""Childbirth Without Fear."" Read a broader selection - many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore. I am a mother of 4; have had healthier, more positive birth experiences than anyone I know. This book is misleading and negative.Make it the joyful event you deserve!"
NEGATIVE	"This film is overrated. Very, very overrated. I guessed the ""trick ending"" almost as the movie started. The whole damned film hinges on this ""trick ending"". Bad acting, bad plot, almost incomprehensible dialogue, and a lack of buildup to the twist at the end. We are given clues, but the end has no dramatic ""rightness"". It's just an ending, with no brilliance to it."
POSITIVE	"Provides a bit range set unavailable elsewhere. My set arrived with a 1/2"" bit in place of the advertised 9/16"" bit; otherwise a good value."
POSITIVE	Purchased this for my husband to monitor his blood pressure....with it we have been able to conveniently monitor his blood pressure and work to successfully reduce it through a low salt diet and exercise.....his doctor is very pleased. really a big improvement from using a machine at a drug store and much more accurate and sanitary.
NEGATIVE	"They recently brought 1941 on television. I just turned on when there were three women singing in the tradition of the Andrews Sisters. Even though the action of the movie did not grab me it was the music that kept me watching. The singing and the orchestral music they played in the ballroom of the U.S.O. was so great I wanted it in CD quality. After buying this CD I was very disappointed to find that all of the songs by the singing women, especially ""Down by the Ohio"", were missing.With only 38 minutes of music on the CD only half of the capacity is used. Absolutely not understandable they omitted the best tracks! This disc might be all right for the person looking for John Williams instrumental music only. For somebody who wants a CD worthy being called ""Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"" it is not complete and cannot be recommended."
POSITIVE	fantasia has a god given talent .know person in the world can take that away from her.god bless u fantasia
POSITIVE	I just got this yesterday and made it through the first few levels and wow! This is an amazing improvement from Halo 2 (which ruled). I think I play this and the others for the movies in betwen levels. When is the movie going to get made?? WE WANT THE MOVIE!!!!!!!! C'mon Peter Jackson!!!
POSITIVE	The writer made a really good job while writing this book, really liked it, everyone should read.If you like conspiracy theory, heres ur home!
POSITIVE	"I bought one of these a few years ago and love it. It was inexpensive, yet super-easy to use. I use it to tune electric and acoustic guitars, an electric bass, and mandolins. The bass was a little tougher to tune, likely due to the low frequency, but I was able to get a ""fix"" after repositioning the clip.I've also used this device to ""tune"" an electric piano... I just placed the tuner on the speaker, struck middle C, and adjusted the tuning potentiometer. Nice.The battery lasted about 18 months for me, and was easily and inexpensively replaced (it uses a popular coin-type lithium battery).I've since bought another one of these for my guitar-playing brother (a nice but inexpensive gift!)"
POSITIVE	As an avid Cryptozoologist- I LOVE Steve Alten books. Since MEG, I have bought and read them all. This one is another gem.
POSITIVE	If you keep in mind what the author is trying to accomplish, this book makes for a handy tool in a writer's toolbox. This is meant to provide a formula for character development. Minor factual errors aside, it is a starting point for a writer attempting to get a feel for the craft. As such, I think it is a good resource.
NEGATIVE	I bought these on the recommendation of a friend who's baby loves them only to discover once they arrived that they're made in China. Not something I'm willing to feed my baby.
POSITIVE	This is my absolute favorite perfume these days. For years I wore Clinique Happy and loved it and still do but there is something in Falling in Love that I love even more. I do agree w/ another reviewer about how the smell doesn't last all day but for me it is a small price to pay for the scent that it gives.
POSITIVE	This mask is very realistic. I really don't know how masks are made but, looking at the way it is painted leads me to believe that it was done by hand and by a professional. I scared the crap out of my kids the other night. They got me back the next day (he, he, he...). Anyway, the mask fits fine. It's a little hard to put it on and take it off because it is narrow around the neck area. I don't think I could walk around with it on Halloween night for long though; that is because it is hard to breathe with it and because I couldn't see very well either. Nevertheless, the mask is very well made and realistic looking. If you're looking for something scary, you can't go wrong with this mask. (Four stars because of the breathing problem)
NEGATIVE	"I was hoping for a good laugh from this obviously ""below B"" movie from Hollywood's golden age. Unfortunately the transfer is so abysmal, the sound quality is so bad, that I might have been watching a documentary about manatees, for all I know.One thing I do know, however, was that oneof the lead manatees was Glenda Farrell...a fact that seems to be conspicuously missing from the cover of the DVD. That would have been a plus, by the way....as she always adds a great degree of snap to whatever she's in. If only one could hear what she was being snappy about...."
POSITIVE	This animated television show was a great favorite of my kids (who are now in their 20s). It combined excellent claymation with first-rate acting, and of course the story was also very satisfying. We watched it on a VHS tape that I recorded off the air.I would love to buy this on DVD, but I'm not going to spend over $100 on it! I wonder if WGBH (the US producer) might have a way of making it available for a new generation of children.
POSITIVE	"This easy to read paperback covers self psychology in almost the same order that Kohut does in his two volume work. You come away with a good grasp of all the basic concepts.I did not find it at all ""dry"". It is well written and I considered it an easy read for anyone who has some understanding of the psychodynamic thinking which preceeded Self Psychology."
POSITIVE	Works great the only thing could be better is if it had caller ID and automatically connected when I got in the car, otherwise the unit sounds great and people can here me fine.
NEGATIVE	The unit itself seems to be a good unit. However... it is a terrible device for using in Windows 7 Pro. There are no drivers for it, and you can't not get customer support to answers to your correspondence, for it. So if your going to try to use it in Windows 7... for now, for get it.
POSITIVE	I bought this book to use in a Spanish Literature class for many age ranges. I decided against it because the English translation was too accessible to my students, and I feared that they would use it as a crutch.However, for the more discplined, self-teachers, I recommend this book highly, as long as you read it aloud. If you want to speak Spanish, practice by Speaking Spanish. Great for mid-level speakers of ages eleven and up I'd say. For younger children, try Flip Flop Spanish.
NEGATIVE	This book is a laugh and not much else. This guy is the uberpale, black-eyeliner-wearing, black-hair-dying version of Silver RavenWolf: cheesy, full of himself and completely useless.Aside from that, the idea of nocturnal witchcraft is highly impractical. Yes, a lot of us are night people and work better at night. But this guy is practically suggesting a WORSHIP of the night, like some sort of Wiccan vampire or something.Don't waste your money or time on this book. You have better things to do at night, like REAL witchcraft, or even sleep!
NEGATIVE	You cannot improve on the Beach Boys...enough said. The sound quality is excellent, but the originals are no slouch in terms of sonics.
NEGATIVE	"I've seen all the oscar nominations and this is by far the weakest entry.Major kudos to the directing style and cinematography, but that is about it.Acting is standard, if not cheesy and overdone. Characters are WAY too overblown to be believable, story is lame and the ending doesn't have any quality or quantity.No real character development or interesting moments. It just feels like superbad.And that is exactly what it is...Super Bad.Credits for artistic value, but it's attempt to ""connect"" to an audience (that I'm still unsure of) fails miserably. A teen Docu-Drama that should have stuck to the facts.Not a ""landmark"" film in any way."
POSITIVE	I like this watch. It is lightweight and comfortable, and does not feel bulky. The color is light enough that I can wear it in a format work setting and feel good. I gave it 4 stars only because the databank pages don't seem to automatically sort themselves into alphabetic format, remaining in the random order in which they were entered. Also, there are only 20 data pages, and I would have preferred 30. Otherwise, it is easy to program and the electro-illuminescent back-light is great.
NEGATIVE	"I've never been a fan of Katzen's cookbooks. The original recipes were drenched in cheese, cream and butter. ""Ethnic"" recipes (except, perhaps, for those drawing on her own heritage) tended to be bland and inauthentic. Although the newer edition promises to correct these faults, I don't find that the food is substantially different. Bleah."
NEGATIVE	Is it just me or does this look like just a computer filled with computer parts. If someone is willing to pay over $1000 for a game console why don't they just buy a new computer with a good graphics card? Also another thing I have noticed, when I was playing one of the games I did not notice anything different than from the original Xbox. Then again I wasn't playing on a really expensive tv either. Also have you noticed that the Xbox 360 is not mentioned much anymore and a lot of the consoles you cannot find or they are way over priced. I see a flop in action. Buy at your own risk.
NEGATIVE	I have done both pilates and yoga prepregnancy and I wanted to keep this up through my pregnancy. This video is a good pilates video for a woman that isn't pregnant, but it contains many exercises that a pregnant woman shouldn't do after the first trimester. I have been told by a number of sources, including my doctor, that you should eliminate exercises that are performed while flat on your back or while you're standing in one place for long periods, as both can reduce blood flow to the fetus. A lot of this video is done while lying flat on your back. Don't waste your money on this video if you have others, just continue with the others and skip the exercises that are done while laying flat on your back.
POSITIVE	"It's not easy working in a morgue. But that's what I do, day in and day out. I've seen the floaters, those bloated, reeking mounds of ooze, dripping with fat and rot. I've seen it all.""No Escape From Danger"" is a stellar comedy album, with jokes that keep you laughing every second of the way. With skits like ""canine surprise"" and ""thirty seconds of silence,"" it's no wonder that Conan O'Brien used to work there! A+"
POSITIVE	This is a live recording of Albert Collins playing with a band from Europe. The band includes guys with names like Hans and Guus. The band is good. Albert Collins is hot.The CD includes a couple of tracks that do not include Albert's telecaster or his voice. The lead singer of Barrelhouse has a voice similar to that of Ashlee Simpson.But on the tracks that Mr. Collins plays on, he is hot, and his telecaster is just as smooth. This CD shows his versatility, his ability to play in different situations.Overall, a good CD.
NEGATIVE	"It left me depressed. No heroes, no true love, not much of a story line except ""The sky is falling."""
POSITIVE	If you are already a fan of the Grandma's Attic series like me, then you will want to read this book too! My daughter just loves for me to read these out loud to her each night. This book seems to focus more on Mabel's home and family life and times with her best friend Sarah Jane, and less time bringing in other characters we'd seen before from school and church. Each story focuses on either something funny (as most stories are years later!) or some other tough lesson she learned. Things that seemed dull and repetitive to her as a child are now treasures for us to read, through the eyes and imagination of her granddaughter.This book can be read alone or with the series, and is a great read-aloud book for children. Try it out!
NEGATIVE	in my opinion shallow ground was a low buget mediocre film that seems to try way to hard to impress audiences,also by calling this independent film a horror movie, psychological maybe. Splashing buckets of blood on the floor and on a naked boy who walks throughout the entire film with creepy crawling bugs DOES NOT MAKE IT A HORROR MOVIE . 45 mins into this film i seemed to have lost a bit of interestsbut i was hoping for a tragic ending or even something out of the ordinary but sadly i was not impressed. The movie doesnt seem to go anywhere but under ground. 97 mins was long enough some of the acting was below standard acting and the story line itself had potential but failed by not giving a full detail ending. worth a rent but do not expect much at all
NEGATIVE	Since this is a brand named cutter, I expected quality. There is a small gap between the blade and base where cutting begins. To cut paper you need to press the blade against the base. After the blade is down a few inches it connects with the base as expected. The cutting arm is connected to the base with plastic making it very flimsy. I would not recommend this cutter for an office environment.
POSITIVE	I never thougt i hear another voice that souded like janis joplin but i was wrong.It is a cross between rod stewart and janis joplin. It works on the blues tunes like redunant but it a little to high for him on the rocking tunes like alice.If you can get by the singer voice which is better than pete ways voice ,i recomend you buy it ,great cd.
POSITIVE	"Every time I hear this CD I feel like packing a bag and getting a one-way ticket to Spain. I love Serrat's tremulous voice, and his melodies and poetry are exquisite, and very visual...I get such a clear image of ""Pueblo Blanco""...it's people, it's dryness. ""...por sus callejas de polvo y piedra"" and of course, ""Mediterráneo"", calling me to it's shores.This is a brilliant collection of songs, and my personal favorite of his CDs, perhaps because I find it the most melodic. Ah ! Someday I'll pack that bag, but until then, I have this incredibly wonderful music."
POSITIVE	I downloaded the public multiplayer demo and played it through SpyArcade and I love it. This is the first time that I did multiplayer and it was fun! Very addictive. The demo scenario was essentially capture the flag in 'Quebec' with a 'VIP' being the flag. The sides are a special ops unit versus 'terrorists.' You choose several roles (sniper, commando, medic, demolitions expert, machine gunner)and there are specific weapons asssigned to each role. However, you can use other players weapons when they die and leave them. I would buy this game!
POSITIVE	I did not see this movie @ Christmas time, usually aired on on station or another. I decided to get it so I COULD see it!Seller very prompt shipping this!
POSITIVE	"I just flat out have to tell you that this is one of the best and any ABB fan must have this to experience the original sounds of this group. The ""early sounds"" are so tight. Makes me remember being there in Byron. The sound quality of the recording is quite good and brings back the jammin' sounds that made the Allman Brothers one of the ushers of Southern Rock. I favor the first day recording over the second, but both are superb. After some 33 years, the sounds are still classic and fresh. How is that? Because the Allman Brothers will remain one of the benchmark bands of rock. Favorite songs are Elizabeth Reed, Whipping Post, and Statesboro Blues. Whether the Brothers wrote it or re-arranged it, the sounds on the Festival album are on any real fan's ""must have"" list. Buy, I promise you, you will not be disappointed. Trust me!!"
NEGATIVE	I used this pressure cooker for 4 months. The lid began sticking when I tried to close it and finally jammed and would not open, with food iniside. The release valve also would not open so the lid could not be removed. This is a piece of junk! Fagor said the warranty would not apply so I lost all of my money on this. I will never buy a Fagor product again.
NEGATIVE	I loved early 90s grunge rock. I listen to my cds on a regular basis, Alice In Chains, Nirvana, Soundgarden, even some of the more obscure bands like Mudhoney i've gotten into. This band just wants to be like Pearl Jam and all of the early 90s grunge bands only they dont have the talent to do it. The band is terribly subpar including Mark Tremonti who is the most overrated guitarist ever. Scott Stapp is the worst singer/songwriter i've ever heard and i have a voodoo doll that i use to put various curses on him so this band will never make another record.Go buy some early 90s grunge, Alice In Chains-s/t says Jared, go get that. Creed ....
NEGATIVE	I'm not going to need nearly 1,000 words for my review. Tom Clancy has been more and more boring of late. Too many words and too little action pretty well sum things up..........
NEGATIVE	The SPA2100 was discontinued by in 2006 and firmware is no longer available from Cisco. It would have been helpful to know this before I wasted my time ordering this and trying to set it up only to find that it could lock up under high network load. The version of the firmware I received on the device was a few revisions behind the last release and contained numerous bugs. The SPA-2102 is the current version of the adapter as of 10/2011.
NEGATIVE	"Not a bad voice for a particular kind of song and genre, but honestly now - how many of you out there can actually understand all the lyrics in all the songs? I can't, and that was Part One of my criticism of this debut CD. Part Two: far too similar tones and strains cross songs, making many of them seem like modified clones of others. ""Lights Out"" is the best of the tracks, and, sorry to say, the only one worth listening to more than once. Hopefully, Ms. Presley will improve her sense of variety and tone the angst down a bit - it will wear thin if it follows her album to album. The potential is there, but it requires some serious re-evaluation in terms of lyrics, delivery and subject matter."
NEGATIVE	This bell was a great price, but the first time I tried to push the lever for a ring, it made a crunching noise inside and got stuck. It never worked once for a ring. I brought it to my uncle for fixing, but because the gears were all plastic inside, he wasn't able to fix it. Next time I will buy a better bell.
POSITIVE	I have a German Shepherd dog and I purchased this Dremel Minimite to grind his nails. Works very well once the dog was used to it; he didn't want to get near it at first. I use the fine sanding band on high speed on the nails as I think the coarse bands would be too much. I've also found many other uses for the Dremel around the house so it's definitely handy. If you have a specific need, I'd recommend purchasing and I'm sure you'll find other uses also. The rechargeable battery is great, which is why I purchased this over the products marketed for grinding pets' nails. For a few bucks more, The Minimite is worth not having to replace batteries that you have to purchase separately.
POSITIVE	Just a quick positive review so people can get a fair view. I bough this product a few days ago and have been saving the receipt like a 100 dollar bill. Today I decided to file it. The product has been working GREAT. I have a Microsoft router in my laptop and connected my mother's 10 year old Acer computer through the Linksys USB adapter. Although it says it works better with 2.0 USB's (which are faster) my mom's pc has the 1.0 and she still gets good connections (up tp 56kbs) It is also super easy to set up. My mom, who isn't that pc saavy, already leraned to use the security feautures. All in all, considering how well it has worked I'm giving the product 5 stars.
NEGATIVE	This light control was advertised to work with frosted glass, but after the first night, it failed to turn on at the configured time (dusk). We may use it somewhere else, but it failed in the purpose for which it was purchased.
POSITIVE	This season is my favorite. It have my favorite one Pancake Madness. Sabrina is so funny. By the way this is the last season to have more then 22 episodes all the other seasons have 22. Final season for Valerie and Libby. It's a great season and very funny. I also love the part about the family secret. By the way do you have pancakes.
NEGATIVE	I tried to install the simulator under Ubuntu Linux 5.10. The installation works fine, but when I run examsim I get a gtk windows telling me:There are no exams in /usr/local/lib/examsim/examsThe simulation will not work!Check your installation.I cannot understand where the problem is, since /usr/local/lib/examsim/exams/LPI101 and LPI102 are there and full of files!The book looks good, although I still haven't read it. But I must say that I bought it mostly for the simulator, so I'm a little disappointed...Mr. Brunson: I wasn't able to contact you directly, so will you please answer me here? Thank you.
NEGATIVE	Mravinsky puts it simple, blunt, and direct. He's captain obvious. Perhaps this was a form of irony which once served a useful purpose in protesting Soviet autocracy. To my ears, Tchaikovsky has never sounded so trashy.
POSITIVE	This documentary was made by a British guy who managed to interview some of Pete's former band mates and tell accurate stories about him, but has focused way too much on Pete's addictions and drug problems, so it's quite a depressing DVD. I thought it should have focused more on Pete's life story, his dreams before being famous, meeting Carl and forming the Libertines, then the Shambles etc, but it does not really do that. Anyways, if you're a fan of Pete you should definitely buy it.
NEGATIVE	The pedestal's outer casting is brittle and chipped in several places. It definitely won't stand up to the test of time.
NEGATIVE	I have not heard the cd, so how can i buy or rate something i haven't heard.So why don't you let me hear samples from it?
POSITIVE	Great value, for your $$, beats getting the phone company more than $20 priced ones. I can hear so well with these, sound quality is up to par, and it has an call& end button. The cord is long/ maybe it's just me idk. But awesome!! I have the LG Shine Bar and it's compatible w/ it.
NEGATIVE	The sharestation is probably the worst piece of equipment I have ever purchased. Worked when it wanted to the first couple of months, now it doesn't work at all. I have always liked JVC products but after this dreadful experience, I am gonna have to think long and hard before I buy ANYTHING from JVC. This item will not recognize ANY disc, even the ones I made with it
NEGATIVE	I read this book for a book group and was quite dissapointed. It is on the high school reading list in my town and I thought I'd enjoy it because the town English coordinator who makes up the required and recommended reading lists is a nice man, but I was upset by the characters (except Charlie-Kate), plot, and even the details of the story. I'm not oohing and ahhing over it. You don't need to read it if you don't have to. I hope that by the time I get to high school it's off the list of required reading.
NEGATIVE	I tried to assemble this glider chair, however one of the 6 small bolts included for assembly was broken. The end of the bolt (where the allen wrench fits) was not punched correctly at the factory, and therefore the allen wrench will not seat into the bolt head. Totally frustrating. I contacted Amazon to try to get just a replacement bolt but they said I have to return the whole chair, which I have already mostly assembled and would have to spend 30 minutes taking apart and packing up again. Just for a bolt. Totally frustrating, and too much inconvenience to return this bulky item. I will just buy a replacement bolt next time I go to the hardware store.
NEGATIVE	Exuse me,is it just me or does it look like This game is no fun. If you want a real baseball game, get an all star baseball title.I mean come on, the graphics stink, and its the easiest game ever. Even if you dont like my review because you think Ken Griffey Jr. is cool, Other games have Griffey in them too that actully have good graphics and gameplay.
POSITIVE	The molded compact connectors on each end of surprisingly flexible cable makes this accessory an excellent choice for connecting 240V/30A loads to the generator. You just cannot assembly neither better nor more cost effective cable using components from your favourite hardware store.
POSITIVE	I'm really liking this watch. It has a lot of cool features that are good for when I'm running
POSITIVE	Mighty fine listening, cool arranging, flawless technique except with the sound mix. Guitar base is barely audible (really needs to be out there when only two instruments play) and would balance down the flute treble just a hair. Nicely done.
POSITIVE	"Gee, I guess if people are ignorant enough to play this for kids still in daycare, and the kids soil themselves and puke and wreck the van, maybe there should be a bright flashing neon sign that says ""do not play for a daycare audience"" rated ""R"" means restricted no one under 17 permitted so if you are 17 and in daycare there is a problem at home obviously"
POSITIVE	"The absolute finest of all the Neal biographies....you gain a true appreciation of what it was like to know--to experience-- this crazed, ""fastestmanalive"" from the people who lived in that special time. Read ""On The Bus"" by Keasy, and Neal's ""First Third""....and THEN read Plummers bio."
NEGATIVE	It doesn't toast evenly, sometimes two of the slots don't heat up at all, it melted, the actual plastic where you place the toast into the toaster melted... and it's ugly. The ugly part was clearly visible oinline but I thought I could live with it for 24 dollars... now I have to spend again since a restocking fee of 15-50% will be charged if I return it...
NEGATIVE	If you are looking at getting into working with tin, this is NOT the book for you! This book should be used for grade school art classes at best. If you are like me, I wanted something to help me learn to work with tin. I am making an old fashion pie safe and I needed something to sharpen my skills. This is not the book for that.
NEGATIVE	It covers all the buttons on the keypad, protecting them from dust, moisture and from being read and used. A pain to put on and remove. Useless design. Mic hole way to small to be heard properly. I had to cut the keypad section off and use the perimeter for phone cushioning. A full leather case is a better investment.
POSITIVE	this album may be even better than Up Your Alley ... and that's saying a lot. The songs that aren't absolutely great (most of them) are better than her usual not-great songs ...
POSITIVE	I read it over the summer after my boyfriend finished it. To be honest there were some things in the story that surprised me. I thought that the story would have been a little different. I thought some things were also unbelievable but nothing off the charts outrageous. It was long but I was glad because it gave me something to look forward to everyday for a long time. I was entertained by this book.
POSITIVE	Everyone should read this or, possibly the new edition which has now come out. This book really gets to the nitty-gritty of how nutrition affects the mind and body. All information is well presented with great diagrams and charts for those who don't have any medical background.
POSITIVE	I purchased this book for a dear friends birthday. It not only is a very attractive volume, it is a real bargain. All were very pleased
NEGATIVE	"If you play computer games like me, don't get this operating system. This new Microsoft OS causes a lot of bugs to a bunch of old PC games and ""addons"" and ""mods"" that gamers make for their PC games. Maybe it's because some PC games are old and Windows XP is new. But stick with an older OS like Windows 98 if you intend to use your computer for PC games only. I never had any problems with some of my PC games in my old computer, which had Windows 98. Now I do with Windows XP when I bought a new computer."
NEGATIVE	The original was a classic. If you really like the original then get this it's a good one for the collection.
POSITIVE	This is the habitat only, (as stated, you must send in the coupon for the insect(s) plus shipping. If you are ordering this for the praying mantis, make sure you order by April, so you can get the egg cases sent to you before they are out of stock). This is well made and easy enough for a 5 year old to get in and out of to take care of the praying mantis. Its nice because it has a zipper at the top for smaller opening. It has handles to hang as well. The screen is small enough to allow oxygen in and keeps the insects inside nicely. Great for educational learning about nature and other creatures. This can be used over and over again for other purposes as well.
NEGATIVE	I've never seen cabinets as ugly as the ones in this book. I guess this book was written for the begining woodworker with no taste. This book is lacking in tecnique as much as it is in style.
NEGATIVE	We've had this coffee maker for a couple of months now and we're giving up on it. From the lack of water filter, to the poorly thought-out two-piece top, it has design issues.What finally did it in is it started overflowing. We had not had this issue for the first ... well, up until last week. After a thorough cleaning, it still overflows. We used all the tricks people have listed here, but it overflows both inside in the filter and in the funnel to the coffee pot itself.So it's done. Hoping to move on to something well designed and actually works.
NEGATIVE	While Rechy retains his usual competence in portraying man-to-man action, his misperceptions on SM are still all too present. If you have read Rushes, you don't need this book. Up to the point of covering S&M activity, Rechy does a pretty good job with the gay male libido. However, here (as in rushes) he has no perceptions of the SM dynamic. His details of heavier-duty encounters emerge as ignorant diatribe. He sees a substitution of violence and symbol for sexuality, ignoring the actual perceptions of those engaged in heavier duty action.This tends to invalidate his whole work. Perhaps he should stick to the hustler scene and retire from descriptions of that which he obviously does not understand.
POSITIVE	The mirror size is nice and large, and the light is shocking! Which is great! It folds nicely for traveling although I would say the only con is that its somewhat heavy to take with you anywhere, but its still great product!
POSITIVE	"I first heard of Edgewater from ""The Punisher"" soundtrack, so I thought I'd check them out. ""Eyes Wired Shut"" was a good song, but I thought they could do better. At a first listen, their cd was really my kinda music but there just wasn't really anything special. But when I hit track 6, ""The Story Of..."" and track 10, ""Circles,"" I knew that I would fall in love with this cd. Track 6 and 10 are the best songs on the cd in my opinion, and the cd grows on me each time I listen to it."
NEGATIVE	I have used a similar Fiskars model for various household and classroom purposes for years, but after buying this class pack to supply my Montessori classroom I am disappointed. The handles are loosely bonded to the blades so that the tips do not always meet fully. This is frustrating for young scissor apprentices as well as for more experienced users.That said, I have not found a better model at this price. Also, the handles are nearly a perfect size and shape, so I would hesitate to recommend another pair. I would just like to see a better quality build from Fiskars.
POSITIVE	Imogene wakes up... with a huge set of antlers attached to her head! Dressing initially is a problem, but then Imogene enjoys the ride, even if her mother doesn't. What will happen tomorrow?This is a cute book for children, by David Small.
POSITIVE	"""The Doors"" is what I consider to be the group's best album, and I feel that they were the best rock band to come out of America. Jim Morrison's powerful voice and eerie, imagistic lyrics are backed splendidly by the other three musicians. Ray Manzarek's haunting organ-playing complements Morrison superbly. Robbie Krieger, while perhaps not a great guitarist, nevertheless does justice to the music, especially with his fine slide guitar work on ""Moonlight Drive"". John Densmore's drumming also complements Morrison finely in may instances with his rat-a-tat-tat style of playing. This is to put it simply, a splendid album from a superb group. In fact, the little weasel Mick Jagger once publicly criticized the Doors. Well, this overrated little pipsqueak could learn a lot from a fine group like The Doors, who, in my opinion, were light years ahead of this scrawny little twirp and his noisy group, all of whose members presently belong in nursing homes."
NEGATIVE	It cuts but this is not a close shave. You can scrub and scrub to get a good one or supplement it with a regular razer. Your choice!
NEGATIVE	We used this periodically with our 4 month old. We didn't need it till about about two months ago, and didn't have any problems till last week. We finally had to throw it out. It began leaking, soaking the towel we had to put under it and then the carpet.
POSITIVE	Super Cat is the man aka Wild Apache. If your a fan of Dance Hall. This is a must have in your collection. All tracks on this CD are great. An Album classic.
POSITIVE	I purchased this book after viewing one of the child educators copy in my office. After reading a few tips... I had to have it. I love the compact size, and the weight of the words are meaninful. I am consantly thumbing throught it.There is great practical advice for any mother, father, or grandparents. Great gifts for expectating mothers.B. Wise
POSITIVE	I was doubtful at first before ordering this movie, because I thought it would be the typical story of Black relationships. However, this was quite different. It was a very good and need to know story.
NEGATIVE	I thought that a simple cable would work and then after reading the reviews I thought it would be fine. No luck! Had to return and purchase another brand. It's only a few dollars, but I was disappointed it didn't work on my printer.
POSITIVE	I originally bought this game at a second hand store only to get it home and discover that too many pieces were missing. At the time, my 2 1/2 year old loved playing it and still plays it now at 4 1/2. It's easy to play but has advanced levels as a child grows. if you love to get down on the floor and play with your kids - both of you will love this!
POSITIVE	This book was featured on Reading Rainbow. It explains with detailed illustrations how birds live in the city. I found it an interesting subject, and so did my 18 month old child. I am sure a child of any age will enjoy it.
NEGATIVE	The author of this book does not know the C++ language. He makes every typical mistake a book could make -- main returning void, use of pre-standard headers, fails to mention namespaces except as an annoyance present in some new compilers. This might be more understandable if the book was written before the C++ Standard was published in 1998, but in 2001 this is no way to be teaching C++.By presenting this book as a friendlier introduction to C++ (the author goes so far as to call it perfect), it's likely to appeal to people who won't be aware of how badly they are being taught C++. ...Advanced C++ users won't be fooled by the author's hype...
NEGATIVE	"This book read as if the author just accumulated facts from other writers and listed them in a sterile ""here are the facts and only the facts"" type of way. Not fun. Not very interesting. Very little insight into Carole Lombard.Really a disappointment."
POSITIVE	"I knew this wasn't a record catering to the BET crowd, but I just can't understand how the critics could sleep on Electric Circus. (Did they confuse it with ""Inside The Electric Circus"" the lame third cd by 80s shock rockers WASP?)At times, Common's reach exceeds his grasp, yes. And he should stay away from ballads most of the time. But other than that EC is a terrific CD in the tradition of Public Enemy's greatest. He dares to go places others won't in this day and age. The musicianship and production are out of this world, adding a new language to the often hackneyed and cliched lexicon of rap-rock.Buy this CD and if you have an open mind that appreciates left field hip-hop (OutKast, the Roots, eL-P) ol skool, (BDP, Tribe PE, Paris) or black-rock (Fishbone, Hendrix, Living Color) you will love this disc. I ain't got no reason to lie to ya."
NEGATIVE	"Sorry, but these short stories didn't do anything for me. Maybe I just don't like Laumer's style. Call it Hammer's Slammers without the action. One of the stories (""Courier"") isn't a Bolo story. It's a Retief story that I've seen elsewhere under at least two other titles."
NEGATIVE	I utilized my friendly neighborhood public librarian who found this book for me via interlibrary loan (a very useful tool). So, for any doubting Thomases--yes, I read the book!This thing is an atrocity in the world of literature. First of all, it is reminiscent of a bad Time/Life collection piece. If anything, Kerry's portion was probably written by an underpaid speechwriter for the political wannabe. It is biased propoganda, and except for those purchasing an oddity for their personal shelves, should only be read by those society misfits who would not be able to afford the $595 pricetag anyway. DEFINITELY NOT worth the money. The only reason for giving it one star is because zero was not an option.
POSITIVE	I ordered this product because there were good reviews on different site. My hair has mind of it's own and it's very hard to manage. I used this along with Oleo Shampoo and it makes my hair very manageable. It smells very nice, too.
POSITIVE	Donovan meets James Brown and Brian Eno at the Apollo Theater. No, wait, aren't we in Satsang? Man, this is the craziest, most boppin, foot tappin Bajan R&B you will ever hear. Go for it.
NEGATIVE	Crossroads of Twilight is the culmiation of all Jordan fan fears. It's filled with Jordans overdescriptiveness, with no real plot advancement. I'm sorry to say that this is not what his readers were hoping for during the LONG wait for this book. It seems Jordan has started to care more about the $$ then providing his readers with the action packed, involved, wonderful world that hooked his loyal fans.
POSITIVE	i admit, not all of the music on here is pretty, i didn't really like the banda, but hey, that's her style. if you're asking me to rate her voice, let me tell you, i loved it. i loved the fact that it was a very loud voice, high, piercing, and shrill. these qualities, for Graciela's voice in particular, i believe are all a necessity and make her voice special. i don't think anybody else would sound special singing this way. i would also like to say i don't like people's voices such as Ana Gabriel and Alejandro Fernandez, Ana sounds like 70 year old man with a gruff, masculine voice and Alejandro Fernandez does have nice romantic music, but his voice sound like a deep wimpering voice from a guy who is scared or something. Graciela Beltran, in contrast, has a loud, bright, happy, colorful, vibrant voice that every singer should have
POSITIVE	This is an excellent value. It is the full retail package of XLR8 Interview including Strata VideoShop 4.5 and all the other bundled software. The USB connector has both the RCA video connection and S-Video connection. The package also includes a cable for connecting stereo sound to the Macintosh microphone input jack. After you get it, download the free update to Interview 2.0 from the XLR8 site and the VideoShop 4.5.1 free update from their web site. Minimum system requirement is a G3 233 mhz Mac with a USB connection.
NEGATIVE	Denying the suffering of Christians under Moslem rule is what Said wants the West to do. The denial of Christian suffering by Christians who lived among Moslems is a phenomenon that is always overlooked. As Christians who live in Egypt, neither Said nor I could marry a Moslem woman unless we convert to Islam; as Christians neither Said nor I would be allowed entrance to some Arab cities; as Christians, neither Said nor I would be allowed to build a church without permission from the President of Egypt. Why is Said quiet about that?
POSITIVE	I REALLY LIKE THIS SONG. IT HAS REAL MEANING TO IT AT LEAST IN MY POSITION. I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR THIS SONG
NEGATIVE	Tried this game on different computers and it was a horror. The voices constantly repeated themselves. It ran slow. Tried downloading the patch and still no good. Frustrating to my grandaughter. Jane
NEGATIVE	I gave this gift to my husband for christmas. It is terrible. We can only get one station and even then it has too much static on it. It does work great if hooked up to cable but then again so would any tv. No matter where we went we only got one channel and it was in spanish. No helpful to us since we don't speak the language. I returned the item.
POSITIVE	"Is there any time, place or event Jane Kirkpatrick can't bring to life? After winners such as ""A Gathering of Finches"" (Northwest-based) and ""Mystic Sweet Communion"" (Florida-based), Kirkpatrick takes us across America in a covered wagon in ""All Together in One Place."" And by the time we get to the West, we've laughed, cried, learned, won and lost. Can you ask any more of a novel? This book only confirmed to me that Kirkpatrick is no longer a rising star. She's arrived in the literary solar system and shows no signs of leaving -- thankfully."
NEGATIVE	I bought this book in October - it is now February and I have yet to make anything out of this cookbook. I love vegetarian cookbooks and was looking for something quick and easy, but nothing in this book sounded that appetizing or that filling to me (I am not a picky eater by the way). I'm sure there are other vegetarian cookbooks out there that are way better. Skip this one.
POSITIVE	I'm so glad I got this video. I'm a Reiki II, and although I don't feel that I'm ready to be a level III Master, I wanted the master attunement to open me up to more energy flow. It has made a difference. Now I feel that I can take my time and get Master when I'm ready, and not rush it for the attunement.
POSITIVE	Two guys rob some other guys of drugs...then one complicated, crazy ride ensues. It was an action-packed film with more realism in its violence than most American films, as some other reviewers have pointed out. It is no holds barred and no pretend martial arts or other fighting style involved. The dialogue was minimal, but most of the story could be followed easily through the action. It ties all characters together like a bow on a present, but with frayed edges and bloodstained blotches. The glue of the film was the single-mindedness of a father, who is chased by both gang members, and members of his station through a nightclub. This nightclub seems to have something for everyone in its labyrinthine layout from classy to seedy. It was just plain fun. Hope you enjoy it,too.
NEGATIVE	"The irony of the first words ""there is nothing wrong with your DVD player"" is apparent minutes into the third episode on disc 3 where we get freeze, stutter, freeze, stutter so on and so on until the original enthusiasm for the series completely leaves you. Then your annoyance grows bigger and bigger when this happens to almost all the following episodes until you want to throw your DVD player across the room. ""Now there is plenty wrong with your DVD player"". These studios blow loud about piracy but don't give a damn about giving customers quality products. This is my second time around as I had the same problem with this set already and lost my money because I didn't get around to the third and fourth discs until months later. Once is bad enough, twice is..... I don't care about this series any more."
POSITIVE	"When I first listened to this album I think much of it. I found it little depressing compared to ""Lay it Down,"" but after listing to it for a while it really grew on me. Now I find the music incredibly soothing. While it doesn't make the best first impression, it's very well done."
NEGATIVE	No good. I used it only once to test how it worked.... then 3 days later when I actually wanted to use it, it was dead... lights out... Still waiting for my refund.
POSITIVE	My old computer crashed and I didn't have a disk for my Money 2006 when I built my new computer. The product was no longer available anywhere, but I found it at Amazon.com.Received it in excellant condition in its original packaging, and I was able totransfer all my old files into it without a hitch, right back to where I was right before the crash.
POSITIVE	Ever since the IPTU test was about to start,everyone mostly the teachers,was afraid that something bad might happen.Most of the teachers were changing what they do,like Mrs.Slopdown changing from having chips to having fish and other kinds of brain foods.And the principal Mr.Wiggins is losing his wig over #2 pencils .Then the art teacher is teaching them how to bubble in answers,and the P.E teacher is teaching them yoga.But I don't want to tell you the whole story.
NEGATIVE	"The tool has sockets for 1/2"" and 3/4"" gas valves. My gas valve is slightly larger than 1/2"" (maybe 5/8"" by PG&E in California) and the 3/4"" socket was way to big to close the gas valve. So, check the size of your gas shut off valve first before buying this tool. The tool looks OK for 1/2"" and 3/4' valves"
POSITIVE	"I generally do not like reading thick books. This book is not only ideal for the busy executive, but also for that ""lazy student"" who has much beter things to do in life. At the end of each chapter, the key take-aways are summarized. It is interesting to note that Murdoch can compromise ethics and journalistic integrity to further his business. He also has a nack of thinking and planning lightyears ahead of his rivals, and can stoop at any level to keep the Chinese happy (BBC, Critical Reporting, scrapping Chris Patten's autobiography et all)."
NEGATIVE	After doing extensive research on a thermos style coffee pot, I bought this. I am not sure how this thing has gotten so many good reviews. We have a Zojirushi bread maker that we love dearly but this is a piece of junk. I don't recommend buying this, especially at this price. It may not break, but it feels like it will and is poorly designed.
NEGATIVE	they're repackaging the scratch prone double sided discs from the individual sets, my rating might seem harsh but companies should improve their product when they double dip, and they won't as long as consumers keep accepting things as they are
NEGATIVE	"These are the same tracks from Totally Buble which was released without Buble's consent.""Totally Buble"" is not an album that I wanted to be released. They were songs I recorded for a film called ""Totally Blonde"" many years ago before I was signed to 143/Reprise Records. The decision to release it as an album was made by the film's producer, and I had no control over stopping him.It is important for everyone to know, that I only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and I sincerely apologize if you purchased this album."" - Michael Buble"
NEGATIVE	HP really put out a dud with this model. Unless you use the super expensive HP branded paper, the ink will smudge..even after a week. Also, constant jams and bent edges. Local HP Authorized repair place unable to fix it. Printer is very loud (fans and paper path mechanisms). I will give it credit for having nice print quality, but I would not purchcase this unit ever again.
POSITIVE	I was totally thrilled with my purchase. I have several older movies that I have been looking for on DVD and this was one of them. I collect Paul Newman movies and this one is great. If your looking for older movies come and look on Amazon.
NEGATIVE	I received my box today. Unfortunately, the package contains only 2 of the 3 items noted on the slip and shown in the picture...the rope with handle and the stick were there...but no pulley. So, I guess I'm just pretty much screwed here. I thought when I bought this item it would at least contain what I thought I purchased.
NEGATIVE	"The handle on the kettle is not connected very well and allows for a lot of ""bounce"" when you are lifting the kettle, traditionally instability is not something I look for when poring boiling water. Also, when you lift the lid you need to lift it from the top of the kettle and then immediately move it to the left or the right, since there isn't enough clearance (b/c of the handle) to remove the lid naturally.The color is nice and they did a nice job on the ombre effect. I expected more from Le Creuset."
NEGATIVE	Murray's claims have been discredited since the 1984 publication of this book. However, it is interesting to look into how Murray perceived the welfare issue 20 years ago.
NEGATIVE	Her music is absolute garbage and shallow, good for teeny boppers and people with no interest in real music. But she's a good strong lass with a lot going for her.When she jumps about mimeing her songs on stage you see a really fit, finely honed athelete with everything in the write place. Yes maybe there aint much between her ears, but she's a real visual treat to my eyes.
POSITIVE	A good basic book on SQL development. My favorite thing about the book was the nice way the authors laid out the syntax differences between SQL Server, Oracle, DB2 and MySQL.
NEGATIVE	if you want hot coffee, you want hot coffee. it's a nice toy; it may save you sometime by not having a glass carafe to break; and it is a novel variant on the standard boring coffee maker.But it DOESN'T MAKE HOT COFFEE. It makes warm coffee; lukewarm coffee; tepid coffee.
POSITIVE	"Frank Lunn, a very successful young man in every way has written a wonderful book in Carpe Aqualis! It is an excellent, strategy- and information-packed book on riding the waves to success. <strong><em>And, Frank is living proof that it works.</em></strong>I met Frank at a private infopreneur's meeting in Philadelphia late last year and he gave me a copy of his book. I was completely engaged by this young man and father who has lived every word he's written, achieved remarkable success and maintains a wonderfully warm, presence for every person he meets. I enjoyed him so much that I invited him to be an Associate on my team at <a href=""Your Spiritual Home"" target=""_blank"">Your Spiritual Home</a> and he accepted!<strong>It's an excellent book and I highly recommend you buy it. Give it to young people just starting out and shortcut their journeys to success as well!</strong>"
POSITIVE	I bought this card for my mothers new Kodak camera and it worked great, lots of storage space. No Problems
POSITIVE	A very scholarly, well researched exposure of the real meaning of the scriptures, eliminating much of the esoteric meanings in the obscure, ambiguous and seemingly contradictory passages and enlightening us as to the meaning of terms in use at that time. By paralleling the recorded history of the times and the written word of the gospels we are ably guided to concur with the author that the apocalypse is a fait accompli. The bible and gospels should be understood not with the modern accepted meaning of the word but that of the meaning in use at the time of the writing. A fascinating, well written, book that is sure to captivate your attention. Highly recommended to searchers of the truth whether you be a bible reader or not.Louis H. Lafontaine, Eng.
POSITIVE	Like many people, I knew Von Suppe's music mainly from his overtures. Imagine my delight to discover he also wrote marches, waltzes and polkas! Many of these come from his operettas and sparkle with lively tunes. (Did you know he was actually Italian? I didn't!) Well-played by the wonderful Slovak State Philharmonic Orchestra, the CD is a joy to listen to.
NEGATIVE	The Glass was chipped where you have a second hole for heat to release. It looked like it was shot with a BB Gun. The Center whole was not in the Center it was off to the side so the bottom Final was off center. Made in China but sold to Americans by Americans. Not worth the time sending it back. I will not buy from Amazon.com LLC again as they do not check the quality of what thye sell!
POSITIVE	This was a great book. Anyone in leadership needs to read this book. A must read for anyone in Spiritual leadership.
POSITIVE	I never drafted a pattern before I read this book. Now I can make my own designs. It is easy to follow. Has great illustrations and clear instructions. I love it
NEGATIVE	This is not a user friendly device. If you use it on a regular basis you may be O.K. I am not a regular user and I need the direction book every time. It has many many features and the learning curve was too much for me. Also, learn to use the lock feature, touching any of the many buttons can mess up your recording. Good Luck.
POSITIVE	Have many birkenstocks, and love these shoes.I also own a few pairs of Footprints Birkenstock shoes and they seem to run a bit smaller/shorter. So I have a painful breakin period.But these Alabamas fit exactly like true Birkenstock sandals and clogs. Much better fit for me. Now I can feel like I'm wearing my sandals at work.
POSITIVE	Plenty of reviews on this one -- I have to say, my buddy played this for me in 1981, along with the DKs, Fear, D.O.A., Angry Samoans, Crass, Black Flag -- it changed my life! I suddenly felt better (and continue to do so!).My dad hated even the guitar tracks from this LP (likewise the Samoans) -- it was amazingly vile to the Establishment of the time, they just despised it.
POSITIVE	I was always skeptical about purchasing sub-$1k watches, however this model from Tag Heuer is worth every cent and I honestly would have expected such quality and features from a watch 3x its price! Its got a Large polished face with black dial and everything flows really well with this watch. I definitely reccomend the Polished Face and stainless band. There is a previous model which has a Black Face and it looks rather cheap. Amazon had the best price I could find and my other Tag Heuer has been sitting in its case since I love my new watch more even though it was 1/6th the price. If you have any doubts, get rid of them because this IS the best watch I have seen looks/quality wise for the money!
POSITIVE	Detailed instructions on picking the right flowers, how and what to press and cultivating a pressing garden. Wonderful designs with a focus on the presentation of art, framing, backgrounds, and the tools that make her pressed flower design an art. Step-by-step color design instructions, with composition and lavish pictures. This book is very good for a beginner. 144 pages
NEGATIVE	When getting a good deal of something you would expect it would work as good as the original, In this case the product is not good picture quality. I would not bye this product again.Sony XL-2400 Replacement Lamp for Grand WEGA 3LCD Rear Projection HDTV
NEGATIVE	"I liked it so much better when Eric Stoltz lived with that other family and decided to shack up with his tomboy drummer next-door neighbor chick with the new wave hairdo and duds, and tight little body. He turned down the annoying, future homemaker-looking Mrs. Popularity in the process. Amazing! Damn, it looks like Eric got stung in the face by a wild pack of bees for hours and then had his head stretched on a rack after being taken in by his new foster mom and biker gang. Don't worry, these are the same bikers as the ones who deliver cute little stuffed animals to kids with leukemia, so it's all good. Not! Later, if you'll remember, Eric devolves into a drug addict bank robber in Paris and eventually earns a living selling drugs to folks like Vincent Vega, an inane, puffy-faced and high-ranking Scientology official. So I guess you can at least partly blame Eric for ""Battlefield Earth."""
POSITIVE	I love the story behind this movie even before I saw the movie which I love so ,When the Blu ray edition came out I had to have it to add to my collection. This is a movie for Anyone that has ever been in Love or wants to be in Love, It renews you hope that True love does exist and flourishes in today's crazy world
NEGATIVE	Pros:HD 60gbSizeResolution and quality just for outdoor eventsCons:poor picture qualityVOD file extension - hard to use Adobe PRemiere Pro 2.0 for editingNo nightshotNo lights supportPoor quality for pictures and video indoors ( forget to buy it if you don't have enough light to record a indoor event.no charger included in the package !!!!!I.link cable is not compatible to Cyberlink software.
NEGATIVE	I ordered this book after seeing all these reviews praising the information on growing with hydroponics and was pretty disapointed to see that there were only 8 pages dedicated to that system. Still I guess it was better than the 4 pages dedicated to growing in soil.
NEGATIVE	"My utter contempt for this performer is difficult to express in words.The sampling of Metallica's ""Sad but True"" in one of his songs( I forget the name, but all of his songs sound the same) is just ..... Sampling takes NO talent, anyone can do that. He is just a talentless guy who swears alot.What talent.Profanity doesn't offend me, but it can become boring quickly. Please avoid kid rock (his name doesn't need to be in caps) and buy ""Master of Puppets"" by Metallica and/or ""Brave New World"" by Iron Maiden instead. MUCH more talent, folks."
POSITIVE	O.K. love is not the same for all, however, this movie did demonstrate how love is shared for some couples. This film comes off so true for some of my experiences with love. Is this healthy love??? Maybe or maybe not the point is that loved ones that share so many years together is not always the smoothest road. For many it takes strugle and even a little tourment but the point of the movie is to show that even love that does not come easily is still wirth it.. I loved the movie because of how real it was for me. I know it was not that way for all that is just how I felt about it
NEGATIVE	Amelia's trademark is taking all directions literally without applying reason. This time she has the insane notion that she's going to play in the school band. Naturally she bollixes up the works and the show ends on a sour note - literally, thanks to Amelia's blundering miscalculations. Since baking is her strength, perhaps the conductor will relent if he eats some of her desserts.
POSITIVE	I have been using these for about an year now, and they are the best ones under $40 that I've owned. Here are some plus points:1. very sturdy metal band resulting in a snug fit2. compact enough to be carried around, without loss in the bass! :)Just be careful not to open the headphones holding the plastic parts - they may break. The best way is to hold the metal band and pull them apart. A very good buy, and highly recommended.-Amarendra
NEGATIVE	I couldn't really get into this one. I didn't find the moves to be very challenging or innovative. It would probably be a good gift for someone new to working out. It is definitely full of 'pre-wedding' verbiage, which I found kind of annoying.
POSITIVE	"Good cd.Undying is the best song ive heard so far this year. Spiffy ill argue with you. You dont think God is real?""Tell me how do you know which way the wind blows?"""
NEGATIVE	What a disappointment. This phone had very low range so tommorow it goes back. I had no problem with the base station but the cordless phone was noisey and I couldn't walk very far before it craped out. It would be a great phone if you wanted to stay in the same room with the base station.
NEGATIVE	This product didn't hold any of my curls. It actually made my hair frizzy. I wish I could get my money back. I got it quickly though.
POSITIVE	This was a re-bought purchase, as I lost my original copy. This one works wonderfully and much better than my older one despite the lost files on it that I had to re-create.
NEGATIVE	This movie reminds me of one of those lame B.E.T MOVIES.or some lame black soap opera.
POSITIVE	In 1970 Beatle music was everywhere and we thought it would never end,it did though and the record player I had then could not do justice to the complexity of the actual recording. Hearing it now on cd was a rediscovery and confirms the Beatles place in rock history!
POSITIVE	I purchased this because I was getting sick and tired of dull useless knives. I've been cooking more at home and have found that nothing is more upsetting than trying to slice and dice with dull blades. Even my in-laws have this problem; old knives piling up in the drawer that couldn't slice bread or a simple piece of meat without flattening it first, argh! While my mother in law attempted to carve roast with one of her *practically a butter knife edged blades, I decided to test this out on it. I slid the blade's edge against the fingers as instructed (which can be as many as 10-12 times) and after a cleansing swipe of a paper towel to remove excess metal flecks, managed to cut through the meat like butter. Fantastic! It's small, and fits in the same drawer with the other utensils. It's a wonderful sharpener when used correctly. I love it.
NEGATIVE	It feels cheap, the results are wildly inaccurate or simply don't work. I just got done RMA'ing the second one. I have a $600 one I brought home from work that is calibrated on a monthly basis and is dead on accurate for comparison. A twister game spinner would be more accurate at detecting blood alcohol content. It is kind of scary when someone that you know is over 0.08, and this product shows 0.00%. A one star rating is one star too many.
POSITIVE	This dress up set is so adorable and such great quality. My 2 year old son adores it and wanted to walk around the house in it all the time. I abosolutly love it.
POSITIVE	Its not your outlet if you're looking for something just balls out hardcore like The Golden Age of Grotesque. Where The Golden Age of Grotesque was Manson's ego CD, Eat Me, Drink Me is its polar opposite. In this CD he opens up and just spills it. I'm having relationship trouble recently and this CD made so much more sense when I felt like my heart was torn out. I actually had to shut it off because I couldn't deal with the raw truth of it all. So amazing, I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in pure and true art.
POSITIVE	My daughter needed it for a Senior paper. The book arrived in a timely manner and in great shape. This is all that I can say for now.
POSITIVE	Get the wired version of this mouse. It's quite comfortable, and very good for gaming, and such. I would say the wireless version is much more reliable, and more likely to work. Keep this in mind, wireless tech just isn't perfected yet.
POSITIVE	"Richard Laymon is one of the most underrated writers today. His novels gives new meaning to the old cliche ""A real page turner"". If you haven't read a Laymon, you're really missing out on a great literary experience. ""Bite"" is pure Laymon - great characters, a terrific storyline and a surprising ending. I certainly hope that the US finally discover what a great writer he is."
NEGATIVE	One would think that with a decent vacuum comes decent accessories. Not in this case! A few cheap plastic parts that fail miserably to the task do a great disfavor to the name. The best piece of the lot, an angular handle that also doubles as a suction adjuster, does not stay connected to the hose due to a manufacturing deffect. The other segments also have a tendency to come apart with annoying regularity. I am sorry to say that this product seems to be an afterthought that skipped the field test altogether. Expect a recall!
POSITIVE	I was sceptical that this carrier would be more forgiving on my back and shoulders than the babybjorn but I was completely wrong! I can wear my 6 month old daughter for hours without any soreness at all. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I highly recommend this carrier!
NEGATIVE	I was looking for a book to improve my shooting and I did not think this really helped. Full of anacdotes and little war stories. Not what I was after at all. My focus is on ISSF (or bullseye) shooting and this book is about police style use of firearms.
NEGATIVE	I bought this to keep fleas off but the smell is horrible. It smells like old person or hippies. Yuck.
POSITIVE	I loved it !!!!!!! Totally awesome!!!!! I would definitely finish the series (which I have already read 3/4 of) I am a HUGE fan!!!!!!
POSITIVE	A fine little book. The author gets you started with Sudoku without the pain found in other beginner's texts.
POSITIVE	Learned a great deal of family lore. My branch of the Tubbs heritage had been separated from the Tubbs main. Line for generations.
POSITIVE	This book is just like the TV version in so many ways. I love this book. Great for addition to anyones collection.
NEGATIVE	The fact that the item never shipped would be the main problem. Amazon has always been able to deliver packages on time! I've had orders arrive to the house succesfully before this order and since then ordered a few more items and all delivered on time. I'm still awaiting a response from the Amazon team or a refund for the missing product.Otherwise it's a brilliant film!
NEGATIVE	I found this book to be a slog of a read. I understand the daunting task of assembling a history of such a diverse people but I found this book to be vague, opinionated, non-linear, overwhelmingly negative in outlook, and the author's knowledge of the surrounding regions and Islam seems to be quite limited.
NEGATIVE	"This book provides a good introduction to spices and techniques commonly used in Indian cooking. There are a few things I did not like about the book:- it is poorly organized. I like cookbooks that organize the recipes by course-status; that is, I like to see headings like ""Appetizers,"" ""Chicken,"" ""Lamb,"" etc.. Instead, this book has headings like ""Friends to dinner,"" ""Leftovers?,"" and ""Curry flavour.""- the author often does not specify the level of heat to use or the optimal pan/pot size.- the curries and sauces are often watery.But overall, this book is helpful, provides a section describing common ingredients and techniques, and has beautiful pictures."
NEGATIVE	"A truly agonizing experience is to watch this film version of Cheaper by the Dozen starring Steve Martin. The book, based on the real-life experiences of a large family, was one of my favorite books to read as an adolescent. However, this film bears little resemblance to the true story. The film is tasteless, crude, and an even bigger sin for a comedy: it's not funny. Not even faintly humorous.The so-called acting by Ashton Kutcher was amazingly bad. I cannot fathom why his ""acting license"" has not been revoked yet. And Steve Martin is old enough to know better than to agree to appear in this stinkeroo film (all he had to do was read the script to figure out what a huge turkey the story is, and without a good story, there is no good film).Huge waste of my time, but I saw it with my wife, who thought it was actually cute at times."
NEGATIVE	Why am I paying a dollar for 7 minutes? Shouldn't they have put at least 30 minutes of cartoon together and charged you $1.99 or so for it. This is a rip off. You guys are charging way too much and reminds me of the Apple Store.
POSITIVE	I think that the album's best parts are in the middle and last parts. The album's very good in most parts. They do a lot of slower songs along with the rockers. I like Eat YOu ALive, the funky REd Light-Green Light, the dramatic Down Another Day and its bridges, and others. I like their remake of the Who's Behind Blue Eyes and Drown (with its early '70s feel) back to back. SOrry that this album didn't sell as strong, but this is a very catchy album most of the time.
POSITIVE	Lol. It's Bubbles from Trailer Park....What's not to like? Everyone needs this life-size poster hanging on their wall!! Buy now!!
NEGATIVE	"Coldplay has always been an extremely favorite band of mine. In my opinion they are eventghe 21st centuries version of the beatles. Parachutes was amzing, as was a rush of blood to the head, but there is nothing amazing about X and Y. I see people giving this album five stars and part of me is thinking that they are giving 5 stars because it is coldplay (imagine giving a beatles album less than 5 stars). The point is the music is stale at most times. There are some good songs, but they all sound the same. The addition of the awful synthesizer is very annoying with that outer space, borderline techo feel. While the album has god songs as said, they are not anywhere near ""yellow"" ""shiver"" or ""The scientist"". There is no hit songs, only a combination of mediocre and above average. I would definitely recommend their other albums in place of this."
POSITIVE	This is one of the funniest movies I have seen. It's very off beat, but if you approach it with an open mind you are in for an enjoyable experience. Gary Farmer does an outstanding job in this movie, and gives a performance that makes you laugh and cry (sometimes at the same time). A Martinez plays his role with perfection and shows the frustration we all feel at times. I know that this has been said of many acting duos, but A Martinez and Gary Farmer are the Native American equivalent of Laurel and Hardy.
NEGATIVE	My credit card was charged for the item on Aug 24, 2009 and I have not recieved the first issue as of Oct 9, 2009
NEGATIVE	Nostalgia creates such good memories... but... if one is to be honest, this film is really quite bad. Yes it's interesting to see a very young Laura Dern and Diane Lane but it certainly wasn't as funny or poignant as I remember. It's also odd that many a young female post-punk hopeful find this film such an inspiration when ultimately the movie is about anything but music. I liked Waybill and Welnick, but their parts were tiny, and everyone else's performance was entirely forgettable. When you're 16 this movie might be good, when you're older it's quite horrendous. Maybe that's the point? Either way I was basically reminded of what a lousy era for music the early 80's really were, and that no matter how good the memories you associate with a given film or music, it doesn't make that film or music particularly good.If this is an official DVD release, there'd better be a slew of compelling special features to counter-balance the main feature.
POSITIVE	The whole book is written from Billy's point of view.Billy has a friend called LJ who appears later. Billy is 16years old has a driving licence and a 12year old sister. In the beginning of the story the phone rang and a woman told them that their mother was dead they didn't want to belive it, but then they saw it in the news and had to. Then as it is obvious the relatives saw it, too and came to their house. (relatives=Aunt Joan, Uncle Paul and their Grandma).But they were lucky they had also a big brother who was in college. He came, too. The relatives wanted to seperate the family,but Billy and Lori didn't want to. So they had to do something and what they did is easy they told Kevin(=big brother)to stay and go to college there. The only problem was money but they solved it,too by finding Kevin a job. So Kevin had to go to college and to work.......(to be continiued)
POSITIVE	"I owned this VHS cassette many years ago but it got lost in a move to a new residence. I reordered it through Amazon and like the simplistic lessons it teaches. There are 3 different levels to ""master"" but you can simply skip around once you've done them all a few times. I like the fact that the warm ups and workouts are fairly short. I also like the instructor's philosophy of holding a hand on the isolated muscle that you are working which helps connect the mind with the body. Only negative is I wished it was now updated on DVD as my old VHS machine is near obsolete."
POSITIVE	"i own all of the metallica albums, and AJFA is my favorite one. all of the songs are good i can listen to the whole thing withour touching the skip button. It also has a variety of songs; you have ""blackened,"" and ""dyers eve,"" which are extremely fast songs then you have ""one"" which starts off slow and gets fast, and all the others are good too. the insturmental ""to live is to die"" is amazing, from the guitar work to the drumming i think it is metallicas best instrumental. It is not a cd you get tired of after listening it a few times either. go out and buy this cd, you wont be sorry."
NEGATIVE	Edith Ann has been completely removed from this version of the film. No animal crackers, no hamster lady... no reason to watch the movie. Lame.
NEGATIVE	I have been using this textbook for four semesters with undergraduates obtaining a minor in health education and am frustrated with the information that is outdated and full of errors. I will no longer be using the text in my courses. The food pyramid is wrong, exercise theories are incorrect, etc. My exercise science majors this past semester were disgusted with the mistakes. The author's website is decent and consideration should be given to write a shorter textbook with concise updated information. I am now teaching this course without a textbook.PatAssociate Professor Health EducationMassachusetts Private College
NEGATIVE	While this book still contains useful information it is a rewrite of the NT4 version, and there are a lot of pages that are identical to the NT4 version. It would have been better to call it the SEcond Edition. Granted a lot of information is the same between NT4 & W2K BUT if you have the NT4 book there is no reason to buy this one!!
NEGATIVE	"These are cute toys. We bought them hoping that our daughter would want to play with these instead of our keys and phones. These didn't work for that, and the sounds didn't work well for very long. The keys still sound mostly normal, but the phone's sounds are hardly discernable. The ""recording"" part on the phone is a joke - it's very fuzzy and you can't really understand what you recorded, even though it's usually your own voice!Do yourself a favor - give your child an old cell phone and an old set of keys. It'll cost you nothing, and your child will probably play with them more!"
POSITIVE	i have read this book in his original native language as well now as in english . Both are terrific . It reads well in english becasue it takes place in the US . Vian was underated ... 5 stars still underrates him
POSITIVE	I love the lights and sound options. The rainforest sounds are great for him to sleep to and aren't obtrusive enough so I can still read to him.
POSITIVE	I loved the references to the different fairytales within the story. If you like fairytales you will love this book.
NEGATIVE	"The first time I filled this thing with water it all came out the vent holes on the bottom of the machine. Looking in the bottom of the reservoir I found a 1/4"" hole that the water escaped through. The area around the hole looked like someone with a drill purposely put it there. Not sure if this machine is missing a part or if the hole was an accident, either way it renders this machine useless."
NEGATIVE	This movie was a reasonably entertaining comedy up until the last 5 minutes, nothing special but certainly not bad, then came the ending which made no sense and seemed tacked on. I would recommend skipping this one.

POSITIVE	My 3-year old loves this book. He's a huge Dr. Seuss fan, so he's familiar with the different scenes. He had a little trouble opening the flaps for the first time - parents, you'll have to help them on the first go-through.
NEGATIVE	This coffee maker doesn't perform well. The coffee grounds back flow into the water reserve making a mess of the unit. It is more work than pleasure. So I tried folgers single serve discs, but the coffee was very weak. What seemed like a good idea to brew and go has been a disaster, and a waste of money.
NEGATIVE	A disappointing book. Not useful for large enterprise application development. No design/programming patterns are provided for optimization. I found only a few pages here and there useful and practical. Not worth buying.
POSITIVE	Paul Halmos' widely known book on set theory--Naive Set Theory actually has an exercise book to accompany it (Like Michael Spivak's Calculus). THe book is written by L.E. Sigler. It has an excellent source of problems. Will enhance your experience studying Halmos'...
POSITIVE	Barry Harris has never followed fashion and has long carried a torch for Bud Powell This album demonstrates that he is unique to himself and that quality defies fashion. It is superb bop piano with the right mixture of old and new charts.The consistently excellent Ron Carter and the lesser known Leroy Williams contribute well to a very enjoyable session. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
POSITIVE	I'm not sure how to catagorize this book, it's about relationships, and about love, and about lust, and about being true to one's self. It's also about having fun, and about great beaches, and other great places.It's about the journey of one man, but I recognized my own mistakes in life, through Napoleon's, and I also learned that my mistakes, were very natural, and educational, and they shaped who I am better than my successes.Not too many books make you think this much about yourself.Give it a try, you'll enjoy the journey.Overall, I envy the ability and sheer deterination of this man to do what he needed to do, and survive the trials and tribulations of life after divorce. I hope I neverhave to experience that.
NEGATIVE	this is a review for all sports video games:Honest to God, can anyone make a game that is realistic and the AI doesn't cheat it's frickin ars off?Every computer game I have ever played cheats so bad and is so blatantly obvious about it, it makes it very unrealistic. I'm beginning to wonder what people are thinking when they write theses reviews. If they think EA and ESPN/Sega have captured the realism of real sports in these games, I suggest they sit down and watch a REAL sporting event. These games are filled with glitches and unrealistic plays that benefit the computer teams. Flat out, they make it so the AI can do things the user can't. Throw user skill right out the window in these games because the computer will do whatever the hell it wants to. And this is for all of them...Tiger, MVP Baseball, Madden, NCAA Football, all of them. For $50 (okay, $20 for ESPN games) and for the time and money they put into these games, I would expect better than this.I miss Pong.
NEGATIVE	"Most characters were very boring.Characters introduced, not developed,then dropped. Like the narrator's friend who moved never to be seen again. As I recall people generally kept in touch with letters in those days even children.Are we to believe that after years of abject isolutionism somehow the U.S. enters WWII quickly at the end of the book and the war ends right on schedule in 1945. It's as if Roth got really sick of working on this project and said to himself ""that's good enough, people will buy it."""
POSITIVE	First of all this movie had a good introduction that kept my attention. The actors Mekhi Phifer and Delroy Lindo did a great job. So did Isiah Washington. I think this movie is one of those hood classics that should rank up there with Menace II Society and Boyz N The Hood. If you think it's that kind of movie though, you're wrong. Because this movie is set in a different location and different situations. I think this movie has a greater message than Menace II Society, bout equal with Boyz n The Hood. The movie kept my attention well and I thought all the characters were believable. This movie is more like a cop and robber/crime drama more than Boyz N The Hood or anything. I think everyone should go rent this movie and watch it and then write a review about it. I would even like people to e-mail about this movie.
POSITIVE	T-Fal TT7061002 Avante Deluxe 2-Slice Toaster, BlackWe are very happy with our T-Fal Avante toaster. We especially like the ability to toast bagels and english muffins. I would recommend this to all.
NEGATIVE	"The ""smoking gun"" that draws one to the conclusion that these are essentially unauthorized recordings of the show is the fact that the title theme music familiar to any lover of TAGS has been deleted and replaced by ""something"" else (I'm not sure what). The original Earle Hagen theme must still be protected by copyright, so the crooks who put this so-called ""collection"" out couldn't use it (or were too afraid to).I join with other reviewers who say, WHEN, OH WHEN, MABERRY ENTERPRISES OR WHOMEVER OWNS THE TAGS COPYRIGHTS, WILL YOU GET OFF YOUR BACKSIDES AND PUT OUT A SET OF AUTHORIZED, FULL-QUALITY DVDs? WE WILL BUY THEM, I ASSURE YOU!!!"
NEGATIVE	Worked well for around 45 days and then just quit. Vinegar cleaning as suggested did not resove the problem. Very dissapointed. Do not reccomend.
POSITIVE	i got this for my Japanese version of the game..works perfectly in my Wiitried with dk1(us and japenese), dk2(us and japenese), and dk3 (japanese)
POSITIVE	Este pequeño volumen, además de tener un precio más que conveniente, ha demostrado, a pesar de su brevedad, contener las composiciones poéticas fundamentales de T.S. Eliot, tal como la Tierra Baldía (Waste Land) y la Canción de Amor de J. Alfred Prufrock. Por ello lo hacen un volumen imprescindible para la lectura de uno de los máximos representantes de la poesía en lengua inglesa del siglo XX, T.S. Eliot. Una posibilidad de revisar poesía maestra a un excelente precio y con una buena calidad de impresión.
POSITIVE	This is a Christmas gift for my spouse. I also purchased the first four. I feel sure he would rate it 5 start, as he likes all Stephen King novels.
NEGATIVE	I can't say I expected much of this book and I was not disappointed. The editing is non-existent. It's hard to believe that BB actually has any recollection of many of the encounters she relates since she can't remember what she said the page before. While at first it was almost fun to dog ear pages where there were contradictions and poor English usage, after a while it became highly annoying. What did she pay her ghost writer to do anyway?Her arrogance - deserved or not - takes away most of what make this book an interesting light read. There are parts in the book, mostly early on, where she is more self depreciating and those parts quickly passed as good entertainment. Unfortunately her attitude inexplicably changes to something less endearing as she is literally passed down the ladder of the rock hierarchy to a point where she is groupie to nobodies and she feels it necessary to try to validate herself. A pity indeed.You've been forewarned.
NEGATIVE	I used this sharpener for a year already and was not satisfied at all. Recently I bought Presto Pro EverSharp Electric Knife Sharpener which is 3 times cheaper as well as 3 times better.
NEGATIVE	Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Dave Matthews Band fan, it is just that I am getting the feeling that I have heard these songs played over and over on each CD. There are probably 20 songs that have been repeatedly put on CDs. There are a few riffs and adlibs that are different on each CD but I feel as though there arent enough songs of the group to be putting out another live CD. They truly have a lot of songs that would be nice to have on a live CD, like: I'll Back you up, Song that Jane Likes, Spoon, Crush, Dreaming Tree, Pay for What You Get, Let You Down. It does make sense because the fact that these songs are not played much at concerts, but the material being put on these CDs do not have that new feeling when you hear them anymore. This CD did really nothing new for me, with the exception the Maker, all are on other live CDs, Red Rocks was awesome, would recomend that for anyone over this!
NEGATIVE	After waiting patiently for this game to actually be patched and deliver what it promises, I have to say I am completely dissapointed. Dreamweaver studios has really been a let down by release a game that delivers on almost nothing it claims. The owners of this game who have basically been robbed should just be referred to as beta testers, this game should have never been released in its current state. Spend your money elsewhere.
POSITIVE	Greasiness wipes off easily along with all traces of makeup! Did not irritate my eye in the least.
NEGATIVE	This guide is only for those people who don't know the difference between a spearman and a warrior, or for those who get eliminated while playing the Chieftain level, which isn't an easy feat.Otherwise, it does the job it's supposed to.
NEGATIVE	I would NOT recommend anyone bother to waste their money on a video that stars Dolphina. Sure she knows what she is doing and looks great doing it but that's about as good as it gets. If you want to learn to bellydance this is NOT a series for you! The cues are terrible, a lot of camera time is spent on her face so you don't really know what you are doing. If you try to imitate her moves without seeing how to properly perform the moves, you WILL INJURE YOURSELF! My advice.....STAY FAR, FAR AWAY!!!!!!!!
NEGATIVE	Stupid storyline. Poor acting. Just flat out disappointing and horrible. I really hate looking forward to a good alien invasion movie and then end up disgusted.
NEGATIVE	I don't know if the board has changed, but as a parent of a 4 year old, I hate playing this. The board is like a big grid and my son gets confused as to which way he's headed. The spaces have numbers on them, but even I have to look at which row I'm in and when he turns a corner he thinks he's supposed to go up. I do like that the slides and ladders have pictures of rewards or punishments. We have more fun talking about the pictures than moving our pieces. My last complaint is how long it takes to finish a game. I feel guilty not playing it more often, but we just don't enjoy it.
NEGATIVE	"I really really wanted to like this book, since I love historical novels and the setting should be fascinating. But I couldn't get past the first few chapters due to the author's pedestrian writing style and ho-hum characterizations. I was also constantly put off by anachronistic speech patterns. The publisher wants you to think this is ""Outlander in America"" but it's simply not. I've read many a paperback genre romance with more flare and dramatic tension than found in this book."
POSITIVE	I have thousands of pages of info on Lyme having had it myself in the past and having helped others. This is a must have book.
NEGATIVE	"Just watched this film. John Favreau Man he was AWFUL, Is this really the guy who directed ""Cowboys & Aliens?"" He didn't even try to study the real Mariano's speeach patterns or his mannerisims. I blame the director Winkler on this, The guy should stick to being a producer as his films as a director STINK! They tried to be Raging Bull instead it was RAGING BS!The boxing scenes were laughable. The music by Stanley Clark was over dramatic. Which is a shame as he is a terrific bass guitarist.I best stop and wash my eyes out after seeing this gold plated pile of pooh. It was the worst boxing film I'd seen in my life. Oh Boy!"
NEGATIVE	Don't even bother buying it I thought it'd rule when i started playing it I was like this is so (...) it is way to long to make your one Character and (...) DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY IT IS A DISGRACE FOR ALL PLAYSTATION GAMES AND HAS LAME GRAPHICS!!!!!! BUY SOMETHING BETTER LIKE A PLAYSTATION 2!!!!
NEGATIVE	This Bradley smoker was delivered on August 13th, 2011 & the heating element went out on December 20th, 2011. Had two (2) turkeys ready to go in for approximately 40 people & had to run to Lowe's & get a Masterbuilt Electric Smoker. The Bradley smoker lasted four (4) months and seven (7) days. What a disappointment. Thank God I was able to keep my promise for smoked turkey to about 40 people. Don't buy the Bradley.Tulsa, Oklahoma
POSITIVE	They worked fine in the cold weather. When it warmed up my peppers got cooked. Ok to use when it is cold and to get a head start. I would remove them ASAP when it warms up though.
NEGATIVE	"You would be better served buying a board game as this is merely a dvd which cycles the same questions in the same order each time. There are no separate levels, as with many other computer games, and the game pieces are cheap.The only educational value that I can afford this game is possibly ""memory"" and maybe the ""sharing"" of the remote.Other than that it is a very tedious task calibrating the remote and I would honestly not recommend this game at all. This is simply a one hit wonder.If your child is begging for this toy, as was mine, you should redirect them to another."
NEGATIVE	With the utmost respect to the authors I must say this was wasted money. I have resold them here on Amazon. The DVDs, which are not available on Amazon, are poorly done for the amount of money they cost.I wish I had read the Journal reviews of this title before purchasing it. The most recent journal book review, stated that a beginning student would be better off going to another title instead.Let me recommendBiblical Hebrew: An Introductory GrammarKelley's book presents 'baby Hebrew' in a manner much more inviting than Fuller.
NEGATIVE	"Thus far we've watched 4 of the 6 Video's. The graphics on our 55"" Visio Screen are truly magnificant. However, the Audio leaves a great deal to be desired. The Music background blows you out of your chair, while the Audio Dialogue between characters leaves us straining to figure what was said. Maybe it's our two 15 watt built in TV Speakers? We're in the process of adding an A/V Sony 500 watt receiver, hopefully complimenting our Sony Blu Ray Player and therein improving the Sound output. Till then, I'd be curious to read/review others thoughts on the Audio portion of these Video's."
POSITIVE	I love this game! I own it in Japanese and it's awesome!the Game play is cool, you can now battle with 2 Pokemon at a time, the Pokedex is cool, and you can link up to 4 players at a time! Seriously, i am looking forward to the North American Release! People: If your a true Pokemon fan, buy this game! It is the most promising pokemon game ever!Newly found information: There is a total of 135 new pokemon. Which makes the grand total(drum roll please!)......... 386 Pokemon!! Sadly, the most i heard you can find is 200. So, you will probably have to buy both games to get them all.Special: Gamers in Japan got a Special boat ticket at a Pokemon Fair and it took them to an island where they could find Latios(in SAPPHIRE) and Latias(IN RUBY). Hopefully there will be an event like this going to malls in different states as previous times.
POSITIVE	I have been using this stand for about 10 years. Gig after gig and in the studio. No parts to loose and extremely sturdy. Beside the simple fact that it hangs your guitar/bass and fits almost any one of them with the exeption of headless instuments. The black rubber tubing does ware away however after a few years. So I wrapped it in one sided hocky tape and for 7 years it hasnt fliched! ;)Highly recommended!!!-jway
NEGATIVE	This top coat is not worth the money. Go to your discount store and buy their top coat. You will have the same results. My polish chipped within 24 hours of applying the top coat. Armor? huh?
NEGATIVE	When I read a romance novel I prefer the hero to have honor and integrity. The qualities that Rees did not possess. Considering that he cheated on his wife and put her into degrading positions such as forcing her to live with his mistress. What really disgusted me was how accepting Helene was of Rees's behaviour and even took the blame for it. If she have had any self-respect she would have stood up to him. All in all the story was shallow and meaningless. I was not convinced that the Rees loved Helence or even knows the meaning of love.
POSITIVE	People who read this book should be aware that it does talk about some really sensitive topics such as the problems with fornication, adultery and other nasty sins.This book is about obtaining forgiveness and the need for the atonement. Yes the author does talk about very less savory topics but only to condone them and how to recover from a life of sin and obtain the blessings of being morally clean. I am a recovering pornography addict I do not deny it.My bishop urged me to read this book to understand the blessings of the atonement. I love this book. It talks about the true reason why christ came. All the other readers are trying to bash on this book and saying things that are simply not true. I love this book and I know that the principles taught in this book can bring hope,joy and peace to ones life. It certainly has helped me recover from the nasty things I have seen. It has brought peace and hope and joy to my life.
NEGATIVE	"I purchased this collection solely for the DVD. I have all of the music from the CD on various collections and it is indeed great music. I was hoping that the DVD was going to show many clips of his performances. Instead you get two video clips from a movie - the first clip is not even two minutes long and the second clip ""Concerto For Clarinet"" (a great song that is over nine minutes long), taken from the movie at about three minutes. There was a ""School of Swing"" segment that was ok, but nothing great. I can't believe that these are the only good clips available. The interview session is also just ok and after viewing it once I don't think you'll ever go back to it. Where's the performances???? There is nothing special here except the price - it's too high!!! If I was just rating the music it would get five stars. However I believe that most folks will make this purchase because of the video. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED."
POSITIVE	"I remember the day I bought...I couldn't take it out of my DVD player, I love this DVD so much! Everything on this DVD is amazing. It contains every music video up to ""And Love Said No"" and it also has some really good live clips. It also has a couple of interviews. And there's another version of this DVD that has a second disc called ""HIM vs Bam"". It has making-of's and promo interviews, but I don't have the HIM vs Bam DVD unfournately.So anyways, this DVD is a must have for all HIM fans, and for the people new to HIM's music."
NEGATIVE	I bought this book primarily because of the impressive reviews. After struggling with the book for months, I now feel that others' reviews of the book were too generous. First of all, the book needs to be better organized.And the codes need to be thoroughly tested.The content is lean, compared to the volume of the book. I tried several other PHP tutorial books, but I have not yet found one which met my expectations. This is just my two cents.
NEGATIVE	The introduction had so many typos that (as a purist), I returned it before reading the last paragraph. If readers can live with that, great. Enjoy the book.As massive an undertaking as the color printing was (first-rate, BTW), the poor attention to proofreading such a small amount of text matter renders the integrity of the rest of the book highly suspect. I didn't want to proofread the 435 plates (in microscopic Roman numerals) for out-of-order errors, missing plates, etc.Regretfully,Andy B
POSITIVE	I just recently discovered KT and decided to get her best hits. I was not disappointed. She has a real flair for a basic country sound and a talent for lyrics
NEGATIVE	Nice idea, poor execution. It simply does not work well, and is therefore much more trouble than it's worth.
POSITIVE	"I still enjoy reading to and with my daughter, as does she. This book was required reading for her during the summer months and we decided to read it together. It is a wonderful story. It is nice to find a book that children can relate to on their own level, ie: nicknames given to teachers and the conduct of siblings. Because those things ring true throughout the book, a child can sympathize with other aspects of the story.Books are wonderful things - they allow us to reach into our hearts and transcend our own lives. Katherine Paterson certainly did that with ""Bridge to Terabithia"". Read it with your child or on your own, just please read it."
NEGATIVE	"First of all, it takes forever, for any computer (doesnt matter on my pc or laptop -> not a computer issue) to show ""mybook"" under the MYCOMPUTER menu. Starts up very very slow.After 1 year, it started to give me errors and nothing went on it or off the harddrive. Now, I am sitting on this darn thing, and try to reformat it, maybe it will fix it, but I am pretty sure, that as soon as my husband finds out, that I am wasting my whole night on this thing, he is just gonna grab this Mybook-thing and throws it out the window.With those words, you can tell : I HATE IT and cant wait to buy me a new one, but surely it wont be WD Mybook again.I just cry for all my data's that are on this thing."
POSITIVE	"Mrs. Jump does a fabulous job explaining about all what is needed in a writing career. Great gift for new and published writers.Susan Younan AttiyahAuthor of, ""I'll Never Find Anything in Here!""..."
NEGATIVE	I BOUGHT THIS BOOK IN SEARCH OF STEPHAN COONTS, BUT I LEARNED HE HAS LEFT THE BUILDING!I HAD TO FLAT GIVE UP HALF WAY THROUGH! IT WAS TRITE, VAPID, AND JUST PLAIN BORING.TRYING TOO HARD AT TECH AND CHARACTERLESS CHARACTERS COMBINE FOR A REAL SNOOZER.IF I COULD RETURN FOR A REFUND I WOULD.
NEGATIVE	I am a long-time Slayer fan and this DVD is rather depressing to me. Tom Araya's voice is so shot it detracts from the entire show. Musical performance, production, sound, etc - excellent. But Tom is too old, or strained to pull off any of the material - it is sad and causes me to question why they would release something that so obviously shows their age. Long live Slayer...But stop beating the horse.
NEGATIVE	He talks to his hand. The cover is the best part of this Piece of trash. I shudder to think of what else he uses his hand for. :o Watch something by Miyazaki instead, or good old Ninja Scroll or Akira. This one goes on the shelf with Fist of the North Star.
NEGATIVE	I was extremely disappointed in this book. I like Tony Robbins' books and tapes and thought this would be a chance to learn more about him. Well, I learned nothing new and wasted my money. Although I expected the book to be positive about Tony Robbins, I was surprised that it was written in such a sycophantic manner. It was also very poorly written and had all the elements of a rush job. Mr Bolduc would benefit from a basic writing course and some research skills. It looked to me that he was wondering how he could profit from his association with Tony Robbins and figured that writing a book was the only way possible. The problem is that he's not any good at it. Do yourself a favour and spend the money on something by Robbins himself.
POSITIVE	This gentleman can write some books for sure. I have all his NUMA Files books in my wish list or have purchased them. You will read till you fall asleep with all his adventures of Kurt and Joe keeping you spell bond.
NEGATIVE	It is ok but it doesn't set the world on fire. A must if you want the complete collection.
NEGATIVE	I have purchased the iPods since the first day they came out and I have to tell you that it is a love/hate purchase.I am on my 4th iPod with a hard drive and they have all crashed within 1 -2 yrs. Now that the Nano has come out which is not a hard drive as the iPods they are more durable. Of course, with the Nano you only get a max of 8GB but I am going to take that and live with it as I am so tired of having the large iPods crash. I am not up for spending $300 plus every two yrs on this kind of device. Apple really lacks in customer service on this product. FYI: I have been and still am an Apple advocate as I love their products but the iPods with the large hard drives ARE A SERIOUS ALERT~!!!! If you are new to this type of purchase and have a concern for where you put your money, then buy the 8 GB Nano as there is not a hard drive issue there. BEWARE OF HARD DRIVE iPODS!!!!!!!!!!!
POSITIVE	As a movie it was good, but one of the saving features over being on TV is no commercials, got a little more out of it.
NEGATIVE	I bought this mouse and shipping was very quick. I plugged it in and it worked perfectly, didn't have to install anything. I used it for a good 4-5 hrs and the next day (computer being on the whole time) it stopped working all together. System restores, device drivers, dell tech support... 3 hrs and nothing helped.Mine was defective and I'm going to be returning this back to amazon and going to try a logitech.
POSITIVE	Very nice and easy to set up Mic. Especially nice with OS X. I use mine with an additional wind screen.
POSITIVE	I read this book years ago but I can still remember it to be one of the best true crime books I have ever read, and I have read alot of them. I often wonder what became of the killers, Chuck and Marlene. One can only imagine. These two teenagers were definately evil and I can't imagine how they could live with themselves. The author should definately write another book on how these two wound up.
NEGATIVE	When I saw the preview for this moive over five years ago, I was excited. It looked so graceful. When I bought it this year, after many years of searching for it, I was dissappointed. The choreography is gorgeous, don't get me wrong, it's just that none of the rest of the movie is worth watching. The dialogue is trite, and the plot is too far out there. If the movie makers would have shot this as some kind of montage, it would have been better- the movie wouldn't have been as long.
POSITIVE	i bought this bag as a birthday present for my boyfriend. it's big enough to fit the 17 inch widescreen computer that he has. and he's able to put the power adapter and cords into the other pockets. even then, there's still more room for him to put his other stuff. seems like a really sturdy bag too - pretty padded in all the right places and seems like it's good quality. i would definitely buy this brand again. over all, he is really happy with it - he uses it all the time...sure beats carrying his laptop in a backpack that's too small!!
NEGATIVE	I bought this dryer based on reviews, but ended up returning it. It didn't get very hot and it's really heavy.
NEGATIVE	"These do not work AT ALLin the hamilton beach coffee maker. I trusted other reviews. All I got was hot water and a little color of coffee.Tried wetting first, turning it upside down, different coffee, everything!!! and only half the water comes out before machine turns offI have to send back now. Do not believe the ""IF YOU BUY THIS< WITH THIS< AND THIS"" you get all for one price.. These pods only could possibly work under pressure, which the hamilton beach maker is not!"
NEGATIVE	"After several weeks of use, I've also found that these sheets tend to burn dough on the bottom long before you see any hint of any browning around the edges. This has caused us problems on several established recipes and the sheets don't seem to allow for any workaround, i.e. lower oven temperature and/or shorter bake time.Like all Calphalon, they clean up very easily but what's the point if you can't trust them with your food in the first place?PROS* Extremely reliable nonstick surfaces and durable construction as you'd expect from CalphalongCONS* Uneven baking results will leave you with lots of ""surprise"" burnt items."
POSITIVE	"I've used stud finders before but this one surprised me with it ability to locate studs under my homes 1-1/2"" thick combination gypsum board/plaster walls (in the 1950's they called them lath-less plaster walls, consisting of 1/2"" gypsum board, covered with 1"" of hard-as-rock plaster). Easily allows centering on wooden studs and as a bonus, helps you avoid those pesky electric wires apparently ran at random through the wall studs."
NEGATIVE	Bought this for use in hotels.tried 3 different new batteries and the alarm does not work. It's an effective door stop and for the price not worth returning. But be aware, you can get an old style door wedge at the big discount houses for a couple of bucks.
POSITIVE	It describes incredibly detailed the birth and the growing up of this great band, a few years almost day-by-day (not to mention the very nice pitures).
POSITIVE	This is a classic movie that I had seen years ago. I wanted my 2 young boys to see it, and could not find it in any stores. Amazon made it not only easy to find, but easy to purchase and at a great price.
NEGATIVE	I received my purchase and when I opened the box the unit came with the shaft in two pieces to be bolted together. However the AC cord in the shaft was ripped in half by poor packaging. Rather than return it, I labored to get the cords out and spliced them back together. Amazon gave me a small credit for doing this, and the unit works wonderfully. Watch out for poor packaging and rough delivery.
NEGATIVE	I sent my test results in on June 27th and it's now July 15th and I still have not received my hemoglobin A1c results from Biosafe. I went on line and ordered a hemoglobin A1c tester two weeks after I had sent the blood sample to Biosafe. I received a hemoglobin A1c tester with 10 hemoglobin A1c tests in it. I took the test the same day that it arrive and got the results in 5 minutes. Where are the results from Biosafe? God only knows, I'm glad my live did not depend upon their efficiency-THEY AREN'T!!I'm cancel any further shipments from Biosafe.
POSITIVE	"J. H. Greenberg was the founder of the Functionalist school of linguistics. As such, he played a somewhat parallel role to that of Noam Chomsky for the Generative school. This book was one of the earliest attempts to set out a listing of linguistic ""Universals"" -- rules which hold true for all or almost all languages having a certain, different property. So, if a language is such that the subject precedes the Object, and that both precede the verb, then that language will overwhelmingly be one which had postfixes, instead of prefixes. Greenberg himself settled for around 50 such Universals. If you want an up-to-date list of Universals, go to the web site of the Linguistics Archive of the University of Konstanz, where you will find a list of over 2,000 Universals. But, Greenberg is the one who got this industry in Linguistics moving."
NEGATIVE	I have just receivedNijinskythe dvd transfer. It is not beautifully restored, there is no letterbox, no extras which would have been so interesting. No nothing! INFURIATING!Except for Leslie Browne's pathetic performance, the acting is very fine. Especially interesting is the wonderful Carla Fracci who was not only a great ballerina but a great actress. Even George was good. Beautifully filmed, wonderful, accurate costumes and sets make this a film worth seeing. Sadly, the dance sequences and short and cut. I would have been willing to sit another hour for more, especially the intriguing reconstruction of Jeux. Lets have a dvd with the movie restored to it's original beauty and LOTS OF EXTRAS!!!! The VHS copy is horrible.
POSITIVE	My Bessie the Basset Hound just loves the comfort of this cot and It is a very durable bed and easy to put together. She will get a lot of use out of this nice sleeper.
NEGATIVE	"...to even think of blaming libraries. Maybe if high powered political figures on library boards across America didn't feel the need to make their served institutions ""All Things to All People"" and got back to core values, and if the American public could turn off American Idol and reality TV long enough to end the Reign of the Retard, there would be the support for libraries needed to house all the items ever published anywhere, and every Podunktown can have it's own Library of Congress. Guess you've truly made it when you've sold enough books you can bite a hand that feeds you, Mr. Baker.However that does not detract from the quality of his writing, stellar as usual."
NEGATIVE	While initially pleased with the microphone design (smoothly moves out of the way when not in use) and sound quality of this headset, I found it had two major failings.1) Extremely uncomfortable.2) Fragile wiring. Failing after only a couple months of use.I would not recommend buying this product.
POSITIVE	"As someone who spend more than their share in the service, the joke always floated around about replacing us with ""robots"". The movie explores that option but still shows that flaws that can come from using it. I think the actors in this movie did a great job and I was glued to the set the whole time. The previews had me believing that it was very basic in plot, as far as the rogue unmanned ship was concerned, but there was actually a lot more to it. Some good twists and turns for sure, and lots of action that takes you all over the globe! I really enjoyed the movie, it was well done and the technological toys that are shown give it a good backdrop as to what it ""might"" be in the future."
NEGATIVE	Unfortunately, this is another example of the Idol folks trying to mimic trends vs. really letting an artist shine. Fantasia is a great vocalist and the overdubbing and layering on this CD hides her uniqueness--makes it a Beyonce ripoff attempt. Too bad--looks like we'll have to wait a release or two before we get the real Fantasia.
POSITIVE	I have alot of allergies to chemicals and additives.This coffee is wonderful.All pure.Used it for years
NEGATIVE	Two shallow people end up together after a lot of whining and bickering. They deserved each other and I deserved a better story that didn't waste my time.
NEGATIVE	Useless product. Does not significantly cool down a beverage and does not stay cool longer than a half hour or so.Was hoping they would work. Didn't seem to do much at all when I first tried them so I took out a thermometer to see what was going on. Put them in freezer. They got down to 7 degrees. Took a beer from the refridgerator and put it in the holder. The beer was at 39 degrees. Let it set on counter for 20 minutes. Measured temps again. Beer was now 34 degrees and the sleeve was now 34 degrees. Not a big improvement. Tried to drink beer while it was in sleeve. Awkward. Beer kept wanting to slide out of bottom. Slowly drank beer, hardest part of experiment!, within 10 minutes the sleeve was up to 50 degree from my holding it.Also tried same with a beer at room temperature. Beer started out at 65 degrees. Sleeve started out at 7 degrees. After 15 minutes both the beer and the sleeve were at 57 degrees.Cans and bottles behaved about the same.Just my personal experience with them.
POSITIVE	These bags are great, they're made of very durable material. I used to have to make multiple trips because I can only carry few of the microphone and the speaker stands at a time. And when you try to put them onto a cart, sometimes they will roll off while you are pushing the cart. These bags allow me to consolidate everything into three bags and they even stay on while you're pushing the cart. And the best thing is you only have to make one trip :=)
POSITIVE	If you like the scent of tuberose you will Love this. This slightly oily roll-on lingers on for an amazingly long time. It reminds me of wearing a lei in Hawaii. This is the closest smell to the actual flower I have ever experienced.I'm not a rep for the product. I purchased it at a Spa in San Diego and wanted to know how to get more. I paid $30.00 for it.
POSITIVE	I once again returned to the final fronteir and I have to say this journey may have been the best one to date. The borg challenges the federation but they never calculate the ability of Picard, Riker, Worf, and the rest of the crew to thwart assimilation. I loved this movie. Data proved more heroic than I thought capable of an android. In terms of new characters, Cochran proved brilliant as the first earthling to reach Warp speed. As for the Borg Queen, she is just about as sexy as a Borg can get. I was pleased to see her again in the Voyager special which aired a few weeks ago. Buy this on DVD! Live long and prosper.
POSITIVE	I had read all these reviews after placing my order of folks complaining 'they didn't get a 6pk as indicated'. And then there was another that said, 'out of the 6 only 2 worked' - or something like that. I just got mines in today. It was a total of 6 penlights, and each one worked!!!! So happy. So these guys did a great job. Buy from them, you wont be disappointed.
NEGATIVE	I enjoy her writing because I find her novels to be very funny. However, I'm really getting tired of the same old thing. Same characters with the same issues. How long does a running joke have to last? How many ways can you crack on Vinnie's sexual 'preferences'? How many ways can you blow up a car? How many times do you have to be in danger before you take the gun out of the cookie jar? The formula is good, but it's getting old.
POSITIVE	I love this book! I have read 7 books but I only liked 2. And this is one of them. This book is a great book for 4th-7th graders. The vocabulary is very hight. The srory brings tears in your eyes but laghfter to your heart!I recomend this book to very parent or child.
POSITIVE	this was the first book i ever read from kathleen woodiwiss i fell in love with ruark, he was everything. when 5 years later i read it again. i was fascinated with the bravery of shanna. since than i tried to read it every five to seven years. i still love this book. it's truly my favorite. from the carriage ride to the rescue from the pirates and of the fall of the dishonest nobleman. it has made me cry, laugh and changed many a mood swing. ty
NEGATIVE	I excitedly ordered this after seeing a mention of it on an organizing website. When I got it and put it up, I was extremely disappointed because the top part (with the hooks) was so flimsy. I bent it to fit the shelf we have, and then put one--yes, one--roll of foil in the basket. The back part of the basket leaned down and the roll fell out. I was going to put about five or six rolls in that basket...obviously not.Definitely not worth the purchase for even $.01.
NEGATIVE	well, many of the customers seem to rate it pretty good. some aspects are - HD channels show awesome. tv when not turned on looks pretty attractive... I had first problem around 8 months later.. I wasnt too satisfied with the samsung customer service as it took more than 1.5 months to get the problem fixed (it wasnt turning on!).now after my factory warranty is expired, it has a problem again... the side of the screen is blank. we can watch the tv in 4:3 mode but not in the wide screen.. pretty weird.. right?? shoot! i still regret my decision of not sticking to sony. but i remember there was around $800 difference for the same size tv.. but after this experience, i will pay that extra.
NEGATIVE	I bought the weather station but I have a few problems as explained below:1. The outdoor temp sensor is inacurate, over reads by 5-7 Deg C.2. Indoor temp over reads by 3-4 deg C.3. The outdoor humidity sensor is highly inacurate, way out.4. I have yet to get another devise to check the acurracy of the wind speed.5. At times the outdoor sensor switches itself off for a duration of 30 - 40 min for some unknown reasons, I cannot find out why.6. The power supply conector don't have a good contact to the main unit.They should make this things more accurate and reliable then just the good looks.
POSITIVE	I think the new lifehouse album is great. I'm from holland and here this album is not even for sale. I don't think this is the best album they made so far. But that is my personal opinion. I'm more into songs like simon, hanging by a moment and you and me. There are not many songs like that on the album. Even though it's a great album
POSITIVE	This is just what I needed, the individual containers fit in my pocket and reminds me to take my pills during the day.
POSITIVE	Awesome Sci Fi flick! Classic! I loved it! It reminds me of the Fifth Element & Star Trek! Give it a chance! It's pretty good entertainment! 5 stars!
POSITIVE	My personal opinion is that people who say that the American version is worse because they use eye candy and special effects to scare us with only some jumps but no actually creepy parts definitely did not see both movies with the mindset of seeing two different movies. You have to realize that what scares Americans is completely different from what scares people of any other culture in the world...every culture has a different opinion when it comes to fear. Unfortunately, not everyone can freely watch two movies in different languages that have a similar plot but different methods of scaring and like the both of them. Unfortunately, Ringu and The Ring cannot be compared because they were both influenced by their country.
POSITIVE	Very helpful with an LLC in California. Insightful information as to California Codes and structural composition of the limited liability company.While ongoing affairs are not covered, that is the beauty of the LLC. Resolutions, meetings of shareholders and managers are not required to maintain limited liability characteristics.
POSITIVE	Do you like to try hard when you go to work? Do you want every project be better than the last? Do you feel good about yourself if you can make things easier or smoother for someone else? All without really wanting anything in return but maybe a smile and a wave?Is someone lying to, or about you, undermining you, or taking credit for your efforts, all to improve their perceived lot in the company? Is this person taking away your desire to do your best or go the extra mile?If you can answer yes to _any_ of these questions you owe it to yourself to read this book. It doesn't offer much in the way to get around the situation, but knowing what your up against can help you pick a course before you become roadkill.
NEGATIVE	I wish this book would have followed through with the other books. Like Stardust being bred to renegade. and how come renegade isnt in this book? he was a racehorse so why cant they race promise too?? and what ever happened to Wanderer and Wanderer's Quest? i thought Wanderer was the best broodmare at Edgardale how come they NEVER menchon her anymore? did i miss something? I think the first few books from this series were MUCH better then these last ones. But i read them anyway lol.One more thing, remember when ashleigh got Lightning and she was abused and skinny and it took like 6 months or whatever to get her ready for riding, why would it only take a couple of weeks to get Promise ready for riding when he had been just as badly abused and malnurished as Lightning? Oh and howcome we never hear about Lightning or Hopewell anymore?? doesnt Ashleigh care about Lightning any more or the kids at Hopewell?
POSITIVE	This is a wonderful addition to the literature on ballet. The auther makes her apologies in the beginning for not being able to include some noteworthiy teachers, but the ones she was able to cover are great. The information provided gives us valuable insight into the aesthetic principles of these great dancers and teachers. This should be useful to all dancers, whether they teach or not. Some very esoteric facts can be found here as well, such as why Balanchine likes the fingers and hands held the way he does and why many don't like it that way. I had taken some classes with a Mr. Schabel and discovered his claim to fame in these pages. The Great Jean Babilee is even discused. You might also get some good ideas for further reading in this book as I did.
NEGATIVE	We love the Cheetahs but this movie isn't very good. You don't want to see fighting and controversy in a movie for this age group.
NEGATIVE	I have to say, if Seduction Cinema wanted to produce a best of tape, they should have just done that, rather than this ..., hodge-podge of clips with a horribly written framing sequence that consists of Kelli Summers against a white wall. Summers is super hot, but this movie is not worth picking up. Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan. There are many great Seduction Cinema titles(Erotic Survivor, Erotic With Project, Witchbabe, Erotic Ghost, Roxanna, Mistress Frankenstein, Titanic 2000). Skip this one, though, or buy it for Kelli Summers, who is hands down the hottest babe since Laurie Wallace!
POSITIVE	This is truly a return to classic Journey. Arrival takes me back to Escape. I will always miss Steve Perry, however it makes it easier to move on with this album. Steve Agueri is an almost match and will fill Perry's shoes quite nice. Tracks like Higher Place, Signs of Life, I got a reason and All the Way are immediate Journey Classics. Schon's guitar work is masterful and it is nice to hear Cain using the Piano in rockers ala Don't stop believing. Candidate for rock album of the year!
POSITIVE	"I bought this book because I thought so highly of Mr. Waters' book, ""The Best Defense."" This is also a good book, but the subject is not what I was expecting. I should have read the commentary and reviews more carefully.I was expecting more stories of people who had defended themselves with a firearm, but this book doesn't really cover that subject. This book is about people who banded together to defend their communities against outlaws. It is not about personal protection.Most of the stories are about bank robberies and how the local citizenry thwarted them. The most recent event covered in this book occurred in the 1930's. This is primarily a history book.Although the book could have been edited better, Mr. Waters has done his research well, and he gives a good accounting of each of the covered events. If you are looking for this sort of thing, you will enjoy this book. I was looking for something else."
POSITIVE	I don't usually take the time to write reviews but this book was so helpful I was compelled to. I bought several budget wedding books and this one was the only one I really used. I read it cover to cover and got lots of USEFUL information. If you are planning a wedding this is the only one you need!
POSITIVE	"I just watched this last night and I really enjoyed it. Jake and Anne are so talented they make you care about the characters they play. The storyline really makes you hate lawyers and the drug companies (they are the problem along with the current administration); but I digress. Jamie (Jake) is a self-centered hedonist who's only goal is to put another notch on his belt or even better...put a notch on the belt while making money. Maggie (Anne) is a former artist who can't bear to get close to any one because she's scared to death she'll be left alone so she believes if she just shuts off her feelings she never get hurt. Jamie falls hard for Maggie and Maggie finally opens her heart. We know that the ""true"" ending will not be happy but we, as an audience, are willing to watch the present fairytale and be happy for them in the moment. One line that really hit me hard was ""I need you more than you need me.""...How many times have you felt like that? I have!"
NEGATIVE	[...] This young girl is having fun and she's got the personality that kids can relate to, that's it!She is NOT terribly talented and is doing NOTHING new. She's just imitating the big girls (who also are limited in the talent department) and children don't know any better. But, let them have their fun -- it's better than seeing them playing with guns or bullying other kids.
POSITIVE	I'm so happy that I bought this for my new little man, Connor Thomas. He loves it. At first I was only going to buy one but I got such a good deal, that I got three (blue, white and green.) And what a good decision that was! Connor loves his blankets! We have to have one with us at all times. They're light weight, perfect for crib bedding, beautiful, and sooo soft!!! WOW! I wish this brand sold them in larger sizes for my bed. I'm very please with my purchase. If you buy one you won't regret. Worth every cent.
POSITIVE	"Refreshing... Dr. Goodall doesn't hold true to what we usually think of as the customary ""atheistic/agnostic"" viewpoint of most scientists. Here is someone who delivers more food for thought in a few pages than many preachers do in lengthy sermons from pulpits! Here is an example of what homo sapiens was meant to be... someone who truly believes that an individual can make a difference, and to prove it, she has made a difference and implores others to, as well. A motivating and inspiring piece that deserves a place on everyone's book shelf! Dr. Jane's going to find this book a hard act to follow... and I'll be hard-pressed to find another so enjoyable! Looking forward to her next ""journey""."
NEGATIVE	I have an Aunt and an Uncle that work for Compaq, so I got this computer relatively cheap. I was very excited when I got it because at the time it was one of the fastest on the market. About three months after I got it, it started shutting off whenever it wanted, more and more frequently, and the fan WILL NOT STOP, even when the CPU usage is below 3%!!! I sent it back, not once, but twice! Same problem over and over again. Now my warranty is up, same problem... Do you think that Compaq's customer service would help me or my family members that worked for them?? NO. Not only does it still shut off all the time, but the cd-drive is burnt to hell... cant even read a cd-rom. Guess what else? The floppy drive wont work either. All I can do is type in MS Word for about an hour, thats it. I would never reccomend this computer to even my worst enemies. GET A DELL. SERIOUSLY.
NEGATIVE	I thought this book would be really helpful to have, but I have never used it. The drinks are very involved and require multiple alcohols per drink. I don't keep much alcohol on hand, so it wasn't really realistic for me to make these types of drinks.
NEGATIVE	"Admirers of drum technique will find lots to listen in awe at in these two albums. Billy Cobham is a technician almost without peer.That said, as musical and artistic ventures both these albums are ultimate failures, and represent some of the worst of late 1970's fusion. I can only laugh when I hear Kamal singing ""Early Libra"" - it is pseudo-spiritual dross, no doubt written in good faith, but so maudlin as to beggar belief. Hallmark Card sentiments dressed in orchestral excess.These albums have dated very, very badly. The only reason I hold onto this double album set is to teach me a lesson about bad taste.If you are looking for the definitive Billy Cobham album, buy ""Spectrum"", and leave this one for the trainspotters and drum geeks !"
POSITIVE	This was a very informative book. It is always hard to write a biography on such an important person, you could spend volumes writing about just one part. That being said, I feel that the latter half of Franklin's life got the short shrift, compared to the thoroughness the rest of his life recieved.Overall, a very good book, and any novice on the founding of our country should read.
POSITIVE	John Grisham chose a compelling story to feature in his true crime book about Ron Williamson's scandalous treatment at the hands of Ada, Oklahoma police and prosecutors. It's too bad the book is not quite as great a read as it is an important and empathetic discussion of justice gone awry. Now I understand he's signed onto a movie deal for the book, a film that I'll no doubt rush out to see. Grisham may write better when he relies on his imagination rather than the record, but I'm truly thankful that he made the effort to write this book and I'm pleased he's apparently gone on to help the unfortunate soul who was convicted with Williamson, Dennis Fritz, sell his own book about the experience. Don't give up on the true crime genre John. You'll get even better at it.
NEGATIVE	Only bought this book because it was on my syllibus for a class in University. The book itself is very outdated, bad written and unorganized! Can only recommend it if you HAVE to buy it!
POSITIVE	It's one of the first books I've read in English. I've read it many times after in English and Polish and I never get bored with it. I absolutely love it. For the language, storyline, heroine.
POSITIVE	Great book , easy read makes you feel as though you are there with Taco through hid journey. Will be reading the follow up.
NEGATIVE	I really liked this case for the 6 months that it remained intact. It was stylish, held my phone securely, and worked well. Then yesterday the belt clip began to tear off for no apparent reason. I'm lucky it didn't rip all the way off or I might have lost my phone. I am very careful with my stuff and had not misused the case in any way.So, I contacted DLO support confident that they would replace it, as it was clearly defective. However I got a response from customer support stating that they offer no warranty and I am basically out of luck. Then I started looking online and it looks like this is a common problem. I would steer clear of this case, unless you only plan on using if for a few months.
NEGATIVE	Waiting to return this product. It has completely exploded in the box. Please send me info on how I can return.
NEGATIVE	I know what you're thinking: I could use some spare beats and pieces for my next track. And what a price! All I have ot do is plug up my sampler to my CD player and I'm MONEY!Well, you get what you pay for, and I want you to take a look at that price one more time. I've gotten sample CDs that had about as many tracks as this for at least double the price, and for fair reason: this one is horrid. The beats are dated and lame for the most part, and they sound as if they've been recorded on a tape player, then burned to CD. There's tape hiss or air or something going on with each track. You couldn't sample it if you wanted to!Not to mention that some of the stuff is decidedly UNroyalty free as far as I'm concerned: there were at least 2 recognizable riffs that would get you put in court in 5 minutes if you used them on a project. What if the ones I didn't recognize were unroyalty-free as well? Ugh.Bad, bad purchase all around.
POSITIVE	John O'Donohue's beautiful voice brings alive the poetry of his words to open, soften, delight, inspire listeners to a deeper sence of the Mystery, God which is all around us expressed in everyday life through the infinate sources of Beauty. His book is equally wonderful, hearing his Irish voice is like adding music.
NEGATIVE	There is no doubt that the man formally known as Harry Houdini led an interesting life. Sprinkled throughout this book are reminders of such. And yet, the authors' compilation of all this facts contributes to this book's lack in interest. Events and stories are not told chronologically, which wouldn't normally be a problem if there were some sort of other ordering system in place. Instead, things appear to be thrown in haphazardly, making it hard to keep track of the many characters in Houdini's life. Relevance to time and situation are lost with this mish-mash of information. Also, while the authors' attempt to humanize a biography is nice, their interposed dialogue proves distracting and a bit unbelievable. I would rather they had stuck to the facts, and presented them in some sort of order.The book is enjoyable only insomuch as Houdini's life was fascinating. Too bad the complete effects of this interesting life are lost within the puzzle of pages.
POSITIVE	Once again Heather Myles proves herself beyond the shadow of a doubt. Bravo.
POSITIVE	After 6 months of use and helping many friends , I am impressed with this unit . It isn't fancy or expensive , but with the downloads and website you can solve any auto related question . I didn't buy the upgrade feature , any good tech at a parts store should be able to help with needed parts . I honestly don't know if the upgrade feature is for life and an unlimited amount of advise , so it might be worth paying for if it is . Otherwise , just stick with the basics . Although , since I started helping friends with their auto related computer issues , I do get lots of free food and drinks for my assistance , which pays for the unit without asking for cash !
NEGATIVE	This was too slow for me...just wasn't my type. Th is more of a lady's movies, one for a very slow day.
POSITIVE	This is a must have film! A forgotten tucked away classic in Afrikan American Cinema!!!
NEGATIVE	The pen fits into the hole of Tungsten T but does not stay in. You have to keep it separated from the Palm. It is not the proper pen for this model. The original stays in and pops out when you press it's top.
POSITIVE	"I use these tires on my drop-bar fixed-gear MTB conversion during the spring, summer, and fall months. They're not ""slick"", but the tread is flexible and the sidewalls supple. The tires are comfortable and easy enough to propel that this became my go-to bike for anything from my 7-mile commute, to 25-mile club rides, to 60-mile gravel rides. One nice thing about wider tires is that they take longer to wear out, but I'll definitely buy another set once these do. The tan sidewalls make them look classier than other MTB-sized tires in my opinion, and I'm happy that Panaracer still makes quality tires in this style."
NEGATIVE	"My son received this for his birthday and was very excited at first. However, with no screen on the camera we didn't know what he was getting pictures of. Also, the different settings for high/low density and resolution were very confusing, and we couldn't figure out what setting we were on or how many more pictures we could take. When we downloaded his pictures we discovered most of the pictures had somehow been erased! After a while the camera stopped working altogether. We did return this for a refund. Don't waste your money or time on this ""camera""!"
POSITIVE	For the price, I am very happy with this light fixture. It looks great in my newly remodeled bathroom. I think that the quality is equal to a lot of the more expensive fixtures that I found at Lowe's and Home Depot.
NEGATIVE	i got this grinder from lowes store yesterday, got the extra year replace/return warrenty so i will be returning it real soon once i get a new one.my suggestion, DO NOT BUY THIS!! spend the extra 15$ and get a good one.
POSITIVE	I loved this very much!!!! The more I watch this series, they better it becomes.
NEGATIVE	wrong region. excellent service ultimate stage video , wish it was of whoopie goldberg production. right region came in time
POSITIVE	"This vast, sprawling collection of Springsteen's best work only reinforces his status as one of the greatest singer-songwriters of all-time, a peer of Dylan, Drake, Cohen, and company. These pretentious one-star reviews bemoaning his politics miss the point entirely, ignoring his wonderful, poetic, and (mostly) apolitical music to instead focus on what he does when he's not writing or performing. You're supposed to be writing a MUSIC review, not some irrational, right-wing political screed. Go home and listen to some senseless ""American"" drivel like Toby Keith or Darryl Worley; those guys between them don't have as much talent as Springsteen does in his right thumb."
POSITIVE	While the book is prophehtic and contains some little known facts much of the informtion in this book is common knowledge to the well informed. It often seemed to me to be a recitation of facts collected elsewhere and while the authors warnings and recommendations are extraordinary considering when the book was written. It comes off flat and uninteresting.For those less informed on the subject it's highly recommened for those looking for even deeper information I don't recommend it.Additionally the book does little to actually discuss the origins of terrorism as the title indicates. It is more about the possabilities today and the cross breeding of narco-crime and terrorism.
NEGATIVE	"I purchased these Levis 569 Loose fit jeans because these are the closest jeans I could find that are like the old Levi Silver Tab Baggy jeans. I workout a lot and my thighs are larger than normal peoples, fashion trends seem to be going to these ""skinny"" jeans. So these were way too tight for my liking, not a lot of room. I personally dont like these jeans. If youre the ""average"" size person they would probably work well, but if youre more athletically built. Stay away. Ive sent mine back."
NEGATIVE	I picked up this hose on sale at the Country Bumpkin when picking up some mums, and I thought it was a great idea. After using it a few days it just got all tangled anyway. Probably not their fault as I need a longer hose and I was stretching it to try and get it where it had to go. I still use it, but it isn't all neat coils anymore.
NEGATIVE	"The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is that the print was beautiful. The beach scenes show up so clear on my LED TV it was almost 3D.Salma Hayek's character seemed to be based off of the woman in the documentary ""Cocaine Cowboys"" and that woman was like a black widow spider and a shark rolled up in one deadly package.The characters in the movie were SAVAGES and they would have killed the threesome the moment Ben and Chon rejected their offer and attempted to run.Benicio Del Toro's performance was excellent. In fact without him, Salma Hayek, John Travolta the movie would have been a total waste of time.Regardless of what happened to ""O"" how did that airhead become a ruthless killer when Ben tossed his cookies when they robbed the cartel?The movie would have made better sense if O was a wife or the cartel kidnapped a child but even the O admitted she was a slut. Go figure.Glad that I didn't waste my money at the movies."
NEGATIVE	I had one of these when I was a child. It was delicate and probably inexpensive. But this one that I just bought puts a new spin on delicate and inexpensive - it's called flimsy and cheap! This one doesn't even ring the chimes when the candles are lit - the angels hit the chimes but they don't make a sound. And the whole thing is made of such cheap material that it easily bends and dangerously wobbles - not a good thing to do with lit candles. But of course the one I had as a child - 60+- years ago - was made in America.
POSITIVE	I am loving this book. The author makes clear when he is stating his opinions (not all writers do that as well) and offers a very useful overview of how to read the Bible. He makes the point that there are many ways to read the Bible (perhaps the least helpful of which is a literal reading). I am using it to start a Bible study group and, since I was not raised in a church that read and talked about Scripture much, this book is a helpful tool.
NEGATIVE	"I own seasons 1-5 and am very happy with their quality and very COMPLETE episodes.Season six was only in my collection for about 24 hours, I returned it to the retailer for a full refund!""The Complete sixth Season""??? I think Mr. Tim Allen himself would be disappointed to learn that more than a few scenes had been omitted from many episodes in the sixth boxed set. All of the episodes had scenes that had been re-edited. A few to the extent that they fade to black between dialog! It's like a stand-up comedian telling the wind-up of a joke, then walking off the stage before delivering the punch-line."
NEGATIVE	"WARNING!! WORST ALBUM OF 2001!! How could anyone in the right mind buy this cd. He may call it "" Greaest Hits"", but if this statement were true, the only song would be Ice Ice Baby. It was his only hit, and it was the one thing that made him the least bit famous. I recret strongly ever looking twice at this album, and I would strongly advise that no one else should make the same mistake that I did. If you want his geatest hits, then just download Ice Ice Baby from kazaa or something."
POSITIVE	I just picked up the Senco SFN 40 nailer, In one word PERFECT.When I got home I pluged the gun into my air line took a two and half inch nail and sent it right into a piece of 3inch hard maple without any effort.I had a Bostich model 62 and it couldn't even put a 2 inch nail intothe same wood and it was more noisie and had more recoil, I tookthe gun back to where I bought it.Senco the only way to go!!!!!!!!!!!!
POSITIVE	"Thanks!For about 35 years I lived in denial of the term PTSD. Being a self-sufficient Swede, martial arts instructor, logger,a combat-Marine and finally a pastor I didn't believe my attitudes had little or anything to do with the war. After reading Chuck's book ""Nam Vet and now ""Down Range:To Iraq and Back"", the latter containing professional insights by Dr Bridget C. Cantrell, I am now convinced that Vietnam in fact have negatively influenced my life drastically.Thank you for taking time and making this a literature of hope for me and my wife. We are looking forward to become involved in helping others as well in their endeavors to overcome the traumas of the past.May God bless your work with veterans and their families of the past, the present and in the future.Thanks again.Bjorn ""Swede"" Dahlin"
POSITIVE	I read this in 1 day, great love story a little action a lot of sex and to the person who complained about the fact that Wrath is Blind so how can he see how beautiful his lady is who cares.... how do other blind people match and mate and they know their lady or men are beautiful as well. But its a great series I think every vampire lover would be happy to read.
NEGATIVE	I liked some of the music here but the vocals annoyed me. It wasn't even close to the original songs. I wasn't a huge fan. I would advise you to listen to the samples before buying it.
POSITIVE	"As I watched this movie I realized that it is a scene in life that we have all experienced. We have either been a following member of this group or we are still embarrased by the fact that the ""Crazy"" was us!This is very intense; the acting is supurb; action, lighting and camera work are excellent.The story is real, everyday stuff ... sorry to say!"
NEGATIVE	There was a lot of hype for this book, which is why I decided to pick it up. It was easy to get through, but I was only looking to get through it. I did not really enjoy it. I felt that the middle 200 pages could be ripped out and the story would be the same. I can appreciate the character development for August and (the older) main character. However, I was not impressed with the book overall. It was very anti-climatic.
POSITIVE	"If I was stuck on desert island, I'd want nothing with me but this album and the 1999 Swedish Swimsuit Team. Seriously, it's that good. If Frank Harrison were alive today he'd hang this album over his head with a coat hanger and never take it down, not even to shower. I'm listening to the second track, ""Family treet"" right now, and I couldn't be more happy with my purchase."
POSITIVE	I believe that this book is a book for anyone. If you're just starting to watch the show, or if you have been a fan from the begining, this has fun facts for all. However, there are a few mistakes in the episode descriptions, but that's it. It is a book that has a purpose, to enlighten any B5 fan with new facts, and a different outlook on the arc.
NEGATIVE	My windows 7 computer is not able to run this as the screen color is way off. So, do not buy it for a new computer to play.
NEGATIVE	I remember when I saw venard at a church musical 30 years ago. I had such a good time listening to his music, I thought it be refreshing to hear again.
POSITIVE	So far we are pretty satisfied about this purchase, though I don't usu. buy stuff from market place because of the shipping fee. We really like this item, and we use it a lot for shabu shabu, and cooking noodles... It's pretty, neat, well designed, and one of the many wonderful things about this is that you can separate the parts and use them individually, and of course each one is of high quality. I strongly recommend this item, esp. to whoever loves shabu shabu, or huoguo:)
POSITIVE	"I was surprised at how much I liked this book. It's the kind of novel that one reads on vacation or in an airplane to kill time. But I found myself caught up in the plot, however predictable. An ""unwimpy"" heroine is also a nice change."
NEGATIVE	My husband bought this and we have had it over 2 years without any of the issues others have experienced. However, the water reservoir is a bad design. It constantly sticks and you have to use a lot of strength at times to pull it out and I always feel like I'm going to break it. You also really have to jam it back in and water sploshes out when you do. It is also a very small reservoir. It only hold enough for a small to maybe medium size cup. I like to make a large cup of hot tea, but it doesn't hold enough water. I just don't like it and would never purchase this again.
POSITIVE	I got a pack of these in an Armour All gift set like they make at the holidays. I liked the sponges so much, I googled until I found a way to buy them online b/c they are not in the usual suspect stores like Walmart or Target. Quite simply, I love how much suds they produce and if you don't rinse them excessively at the end, you can get several uses from them. The 'netting' that goes over the sponge is great for removing bugs and tar. Believe me, I'm as surprised as anyone here!
NEGATIVE	"I am a huge Bon Jovi Fan having every album he has produced. SO when I saw this CD in a local store I picked it up, thinking, cool! I couldn't even tell that these were his songs most of the time! The second hald of the cd was ok, but the first part was so full of electronic warbling that the real sound was lost. I reached my most angry at ""Wanted Dead or ALive"" where this styling reached its wordt. Still, several of the songs were decent. I wish that the artist had just produced a straight acoustic rendering and left of the electronic extras."
POSITIVE	kushner's book is quite simply THE book to read if you have any interest at all in jewish mysticism. Totally accessible to anyone. Kushner has written several books after this one and most are also excellent but this is the place to begin.
POSITIVE	I cannot believe this book would be out of print. It is a great children's classic; the story is capivating, and I loved how Stover was able to give the dolls their own personalities. I wish this book was a required book in elementary school.
NEGATIVE	"The legendary teaming of W.C. Fields and Mae West has some hilarious moments, but does not make for classic cinema. ""My Little Chickadee"" (1940) is an unsuccessful patchwork of two comedic styles that simply do not mesh. In fact, the Western satire works best when the stars keep their distance by doing their own thing. Not surprisingly, the film was more successful for Fields than for Miss West - who detested the Great Man until the day she died. Worth seeing for historical purposes.OVERALL RATING: **"
POSITIVE	I loved this book, it fully held my attention and I wanted the outcome to be good for the characters. However, I must say that I did think that at some points the characters were more like caricatures. Granted this may be intentional on the part of the author, but I didn't care for that aspect of the book. The heroine, Dolores is not really a standard heroine as at some points you feel that she really is her own worst enemy, but it is because of this that the author successfully conveys her humanity to the reader. She is a poor broken soul looking for a peaceful life, whatever she considers to be enough just to keep her balanced. Finally, all I want to say is, read this book, it is a swift read because you DO want to find out what the eventual outcome will be!!!!
POSITIVE	I agree with Mike Buckley, below. Roy's Bluz is worth the cost of the CD by itself. The first few notes of the solo hurt my teeth! They go right through your head. As others have written, few people ever create such impact and emotion playing a guitar without the sound effects pedals.Roy can get on your nerves. I recommend limiting your listening to one or two songs at a time. He's like chocolate syrup: a little can make your ice cream taste even better, but too much will make you ill.
POSITIVE	I didn't think this game would be quite the hit that it is. My first graders love it. It is always their first choice when choosing games. I like how it is versatile. We can change how we play but the first graders are still learning. This game helps with word chunks, rhyming, reading, initial sounds, long vowels, short vowels and more. I recommend to all to buy this for your beginning reader -5year old to-average 6 year old to-struggling 8 year old.
POSITIVE	Wow! This is undoubtedly the best 2nd edition to come along in a long time. This book is even more informative and concise than the first one. Although it is not a book for beginners it is a great reference manual for those of us in the field. O'reilly definitely knows how to put together a good book.
NEGATIVE	The bag lasted only 1 year, and the electric motor failed in less than 2 years. For a 1/8 acre yard that is just poor. This is overpriced junk.
POSITIVE	Last month, we took a cruise to the Hawaiian Islands (r/t San Diego). While on an excursion in Kauai, our bus driver played some really nice music. Several people asked what it was. At the end of our tour, he told us (with his Hawaiian accent) the name of the CD. .Na Pua o Hawai'iI wasn't sure of the spelling, but knew enough that I could search for this product. I ordered it from Amazon as a surprise for my husband who was thrilled when I handed it to him. It is beautiful, relaxing Hawaiian music.It arrived quickly and we have been playing it often ever since.Thank you again for your fast service and quality items.
POSITIVE	Life Beyond the Universe is a good text for teaching the concept of life beyond Earth. It integrates the primary sciences of Astronomy, Geology, and Biology. I like the way it is set up in general as it incorporates many of the concepts of learning.While it was created for a college course, I have used it for teaching Juniors and Seniors in High school. The first edition is too outdated. And the 3rd edition was beyond my budget. The second edition has changes from the first that I prefered. Over all, it is a good first text for astrobiology.
NEGATIVE	OMG I really want to give this minus 5 rating. Sound quality is not bad but what they are recording are so annoying!!! Who needs to hear a cat meowing (the way it wants to eat NOW) and puppy crying. What a torture! It would be a cool sound collection for other purposes (if you can think of any). Definitely try the sound sample before buying it. But for relaxation, I'd recommend some of those echo of nature or summer rain, etc. instead.
POSITIVE	This was a very interesting book and it had more action then I anticipated. This story is about a fourteen-year old boy who grants his uncle Owen his dying wish. When Owen dies David was left his boat. When trying to spread the ashes of Owen, David gets a taste of mother nature. David is stranded with little food and little water in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. After many close calls with everything from sharks to killer whales, David is given food and water from a research ship. He then starts on his journey back up the coast. I would recommend this book to teens who enjoy survival stories and action filled books.
NEGATIVE	The table, delivered on Sept. 12, was damaged on two sides. I have to return the table and order a new one since I had also purchased the matching chairs. Hopefully the second table will come in good condition. The damage was not due to packaging. The finish of the wood was terrible on one side and there was a nick on the other side.
NEGATIVE	"I found this movie to be silly and at times irritating. It did have a few (very few) touching moments, and 1 or 2 chuckles but this is NOT a keeper. The film is blatant in its use of stereotypes (desperate women/weak men). It was hard to be sympathetic with Chris O'Donnell's character, when he was willing to throw away the ""love of his life"" for 100Million $, oh, wait, he was making the sacrifice for his employees. And why was everyone (especially the lawyer) so surprised by the amount of money in the estate?"
POSITIVE	Good product for the price. Was flexible to fit a large opening between two rooms, and pretty easy to install. Would recommend.
NEGATIVE	It feels light and insubstantial but have had no problem making it work. The tolerances are not as good as you would expect from Canon nor is the fit or finish. Cheaply made. In short, this is not as good as the original Canon remote switch but is worth the price if it holds up.
POSITIVE	quick delivery, exactly what i needed. didnt think it was OEM at the given price and it was. will definitely purchase in the future
NEGATIVE	The amazon download service has this at 1.99 per episode. At 13 episodes that's about 25 bucks for the season. The DVD is $40 for some reason. Is this a mistake?
POSITIVE	"This was a wonderful look back on the gangster era of HK cinema (end of 80's to early 90's). Plenty of references to Woo, Hark and Lam as well as their Western proteges like Besson and Rodriguez. On the level of pure actioner, it is also quite nice with some old school bravado. They ecshewed the more recent ""Matrix-inspired"" trappings of outrageous physics and used the basic slo-mo and bold stunts to win the day. It is a return to form and for me a hope that future HK films can get back to this standard. The only thing that marred this for me was the seemingly slapped on ending with the police chief. His subplot seemed to come out of no where and while the grande finale battle was wonderful to behold (with a Metal Slug reference, to boot) the set up was rather weak. I think it is a worthy film for any HK enthusiast."
NEGATIVE	I should have read the reviews on this book before reading it. I managed to finish it only because I kept hoping for Beatrice Lacey to come to her senses. The incest plotline, which captivated me in V.C. Andrews' works as a teenager, now repulses me and made me want to throw this book into a raging fire. I can only recommend this book to people who thrive on watching people self-destruct. I think the author was shooting for something similar to The Picture of Dorian Gray (Oscar Wilde), and grossly missed the mark.
POSITIVE	I read all of this book and it was great. Everyone who has any intersted in the Beatles Or John of course should check out this book and this authoer. Giuliano rocks. I know this guy and he is good.
NEGATIVE	okay first of all, let me just say that Keira Knightley was brilliant in her role. this movie is full of the sexism of its time period. i'm not at all a feminist but i think the directors got a little carried away when it came to portraying how much of a womanizer the duke was. i know you're supposed to hate his character anyway, but when he takes his wife's best and only friend and makes her his mistress so she can get her kids back..... WTF! and the duchess' lover wasn't too appealing. they could've picked a better looking actor to make it a little more believable. but then.... i guess at that point the duchess was desperate enough to get anyone aside from her husband! this movie disgusted me. the only reason i watched it to the end was because of Keira Knightley's performance
NEGATIVE	This was the worst movie that I think I have ever wasted my time on...my husband & I couldn't even stand to watch longer than a half an hour...we kept waiting for it to get funny and/or good, but it never did. Totally immoral, sick and discusting. What a waste.
NEGATIVE	the basic formula to ruin a sonic game is to throw in extra playable characters, now play as three at one time? no thanksSonic should be about running and rings this game was mostly about that but it gets to the point where you're running around the halloween/haunted house levels for hours and hours! i still have not beaten that game and i've had it for years.sure it's ok...but once you beat it you'll never want to play it again i
POSITIVE	Great arm for my lcd table, was happily surprised when it arrived in black (not in white which as pictured). Really wished the arm could be adjusted and not locked (it can be unlocked by adjusting a screw at the base using the alan wrench) but all in all, happy.
NEGATIVE	I was horrified when I viewed this movie. One thing AA strives for is singleness of purpose - there are other programs for addicts, shopaholics, etc. What went on in the film more resembled a meeting in a treatment center (where nobody there has more than 2 weeks sober) than an AA meeting. There was not one positive role model in the movie, other than the chairperson, and clearly he had lost control of the meeting. Richard Lewis was touching, but profanity like that from the podium is hardly the norm. No two people talked about the same topic. Barely a mention of steps, traditions, sponsorship. Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob would roll over in their graves. If you are considering AA, please know that this movie is NOT what AA is about. Hope is found in AA meetings. People share their experience, strength, and hope. Lives are saved there. Shame on Richard Lewis for distorting the fellowship like that. If this is really his vision of AA, no wonder celebrities can't stay sober.
POSITIVE	"I wanted a book that discussed various childhood illnesses, including syptoms and treatment. It includes that and more. For treatments, Feder covers conventional and homeopathic treatments. I've also been doing research on vaccines through others books and this one complimented that nicely. It touches on the aspects of the disease, vaccine schedule for it, as well as potential side effects from the vaccine. With so many of the vaccines I had no idea what the disease was that was possibly being prevented. Feder also writes about the various points of ""attachment parenting"" including the family bed and breastfeeding. She does all of this without judgment. I'm glad to have this book in my parenting library."
POSITIVE	Great photographs that really evoke the feeling of the Alhambra. Not too much text, but what is there does a nice job of covering the history, the layout, and the essential sense of the place. I purchased the book several months before a trip to Spain for background information. It is also good armchair travel book. I also found that my wife loved it for a gardening book. You can look at the photos over and over again.Now that we are back from Spain, the book is an excellent reminder of a very lovely place. An interesting book from both travelling and gardening viewpoints.
POSITIVE	Very durable and effective lock. The locking/unlocking mechanism takes some getting used to, but overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase. Couple this item with a cable lock and you're ready to go!
POSITIVE	"I really like the dashboard mount for the Garmin Nuvi. It does stay in place on the dash as stated. The only downside is that you need to use both hands sometimes to program it as it does have a little ""give"" to it when you press on the letters to enter an address, etc. That's a small price to pay to keep my windshield clear and clean. Wish I'd known this existed a long time ago."
NEGATIVE	"Joss Stone's a decent singer, but shouldn't be writing songs; or releasing them. I couldn't find a single memorable tune here. I also thought her singing was too flamboyant, but perhaps it's to keep up with the heavy production, which is so overcooked it's insufferable. Next time Joss should try losing the rappers and the big beat overkill. As one critic wrote, ""Sometimes it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew."" I couldn't agree more. This album is like musical Kleenex, use it, then lose it. Better luck next time.On the other side of the coin, there's ""The Orange Album"" by Stefy (Rae) which is a stunning debut. Had Gwen Stefani made it, journalists would have called it a pop masterpiece. It's new artists like Stefy that could keep the music business afloat. Are we listening Ms. Stone."
NEGATIVE	I don't know what these men were thinking when they produced this... this thing... I don't think I've ever listened to an album and wanted to vomit on myself. I've loved Marilyn Manson for ever... Portrait, Smells Like Children, Antichrist, Mechanical Animals... all amazing... Holy Wood wasn't so hott, but it was way above this thing... I don't know what happened here... Golden Age is just an absolute disaster... Marilyn Manson used to say these brilliant things that resented other things people said about him and now it seems he is just trying to fit this 'o, i'm evil, i'm evil' label people have thrown on him. Even lyrically, this album is nothing compared to what the others were. It seems he began to just randomly make up words; such a thing a common rapper would do... right thurr right thurr. Surely the low-point in their career and a very sad day for music. *tear*
POSITIVE	"one of the reasons that this movie takes place in New-York is because it was meant to raise moral among the city's residents. this movie was released in 2003, not long after 9/11. this also explains the appearance of Rudolph Julliani towards the end of the movie - - ""thank you, mayor Julliani. you're the man by the way"".or the usage of the song ""I feel pretty"", taken from the musical ""Westside Story"", one of New-York's icons.all in all, this is a fun movie. its not too heavy, but not too light either. its good for a rainy saturday afternoon when there is nothing on TV and you want a fun movie."
NEGATIVE	I am amazed at the amount of good reviews this book received. I have read alot of books and this one is by far the worst. Why must every situation be examined over and over again from every angle possible. I found myself saying alright already on with the next thought. This is the first time I actually didn't finish a book. I will read something else and then try to go back to it but after a page I am sick of it all over again. I won't even read another of Anne Rice's books because this one was a waste of money.
NEGATIVE	This CD isn't horrible. But it doesn't sound like Genesis. It's a far, far cry from We Can't Dance. They wisely haven't released a follow up to this. I think the group's days are numbered. Unless...Phil, will you rejoin Genesis?
NEGATIVE	It's a really affordable solution so I thought I'd give it a try. Evidently it was the last one they had because they had to hunt around for it to get it shipped (and I don't think it's available anymore). One bulb failed almost immediately but the other one is going strong and I'm not tearing apart the fountain over that one bulb.Vendor's got some pretty cool products, though.
NEGATIVE	"For those of you who love Mariah Carey, good news. Now you can get twice as much of her music. Coco Lee even looks like Mariah Carey! Like Mariah Carey, she also makes sad attempts at being ""urban"" and ""hip"" with her weak dabbling in R&B. And for those of you who loath Mariah Carey, you have been amply warned of this oncoming menace."
NEGATIVE	I think that Jennifer Lopez ruins every movie she's in with her terrible acting. It never gets any better. Trust me, don't waste your time.
NEGATIVE	This is a horribly unreliable product. I have it for less than a month. It has already stopped working. It'll cost me more just to send it back for a replacement.
POSITIVE	These are a must have, you're out and about with no trash can around. These smell nice and are easy to stuff into the diaper bag. My pediatrician doesn't allow you to leave diapers in their trash, so I always keep the little baggies with me until I can dump them in the trash.
NEGATIVE	I wanted and got a light weight phone with a low profile, adjustable volume, mellow ringer, mute button, and speed dialing.I settled for a unit lacking an included headset and lacking caller id. However, I need a phone that works and this one doesn't. A defective phone is probably a fluke but when this one came in, I trashed my dropped-once-too-often phone and I just can't take the chance.
POSITIVE	Love these - much handier & tidier than using tear off plastic wraps to cover bowls - Plus, they offer a more secure fit. I even use the smaller ones to wrap & protect the cut, unused ends of onions, lemons, tomatoes, cantaloupes, etc. After a vigorous search of my local grocery stores & big box stores, who used to offer similar covers, came up empty handed, I was disappointed to be informed by a store manager that they no longer carried the covers because the manufacturer stopped making them. I am so glad I found a place where I am once again able to buy round, plastic bowl covers. I also like the fact that they can be washed & reused which is an added value.
NEGATIVE	As others have said about Broil King it came like it had sand under the nonstick coating. The temp is so uneven that I would never try and cook with it. When it said it was at 350F my infrared temp read 468F on the hot side and 279F on the other. I can't believe all the positive reviews I found by so called testing groups . I'm glad I ordered it from Amazon, They take great care of there customers.
POSITIVE	My high school aged daughter is in her third year of Japanese. This is the kanji dictionary her Sensei (from Japan!) recommended, and she loves it. She says it is very useful, and especially likes that stroke sequence instructions for kanji writing are given. She says the dictionary is organized in an way which makes it easier to use than other Japanese dictionaries she has used.
POSITIVE	My Labrador Retriever just LOVES this plush, over-sized bone-shaped toy, although it is NOT A CHEW TOY as my Lab has 'opened' it a couple of times over 6 mos. and we've had to sew it back closed. In spite of this, she LOVES the stuffed bone so much that the sewing occasionally is worth it. In terms of value, it is certainly worth <$10, but when you add 50%+ more for S&H it becomes borderline in terms of value. So I would give it 3-stars (OK product for $$) but my Lab would give it 5-paws up as it is one of her favorite toys to run and play with. But we've had to limit any tugging with it as the seams just do not hold up to too much strain. For tugging with a big dog, try 3 Knot Tug Rope Bone - White (24 inch) which has been very durable for tug play.
NEGATIVE	Why didn't they make both versions to satisfy everyone? Answer:MONEY!It makes me sick.......I won't be buying this Blu-Ray set!Don't get me wrong I LOVE these movies,but I have the extended versions of them and it just enhanses the story,and the characters.If you have the ext.versions(box set)save your money they'll get the message.
POSITIVE	Thanks for a quick shipment and great priced DVD. It's one of my daughter's favorites and our library lost its copy. We decided to buy this one and donate it for other's pleasure, too!
POSITIVE	"Nile Spice Black Bean Soup is the perfect low-fat and high-flavor meal or snack. It sure doesn't taste like a convenience food. Just make sure you give it the full time to ""cook"" in the cup before eating, and guaranteed you will be absolutely delighted by the full, rich flavor and texture of this ultra-satisfying soup.Keep a bunch on hand, and you'll never be without some good food to eat when you don't have the time to start messing with pots and pans. Love it! (So will you!)"
POSITIVE	Bought these for my Ruger SR9c so my wife & I could practice loading. Perfect size and they work great. Nice strong plasctic material too.
POSITIVE	"The best ""Scrooge"" ever! Be taken back in time to when Christmas was more personal. Alastair Sim plays the lonley and shrewd ""Scrooge"" like none before & none after him. This ""classic"" Christmas movie needs to be part of your holiday DVD collection along with your ""Charlie Brown"" & ""Rudolph"" DVD's. Watch this DVD & learn one of the great values of the holiday season!"
NEGATIVE	I couldnt wait for it come then it dissappointed me. It started good but went flat after the thrid chapter.. .Save your money
NEGATIVE	I've had five of these batteries for my digital camera. It's been hit and miss every time. Some batteries have lasted only a couple months before no longer holding a charge and others for an entire year. The worst part is that when they go bad, it happens very quickly and unfortunately for me, while on vacation so it was difficult to find a replacement at the time I needed it the most.I'm on my fifth battery and it doesn't work so I've ordered a new charger to try to troubleshoot the problem further. Seems far easier to just deal with AA or AAA batteries than the fickle lithium-ion technology.
POSITIVE	this album is just worth getting for one song--The Gift. the album is great, don't get me wrong, but if youre reading this review its probably because you have heard of way out west before. youll get the original mix of The Gift in this c.d. a totally awesome song that mixes the beauty of the female vocals as well as the brightest and most energetic sounds that youve ever heard.
POSITIVE	My daughter has loved this toy since she was a month old. Once she developed the social smile, I would catch her smiling in response to the firefly's smiley face.Now she is almost five months old and she likes to grab and chew on various parts of the toy, but does not find the teether particularly interesting.I did give Freddy the firefly a bath in the washing machine in a mesh beg and cold water without detergent, as it makes no sense to give to your child a cloth toy that you know she will chew on without washing it first. The crinkly stuff still works, even three washes later.I am not fond of the mirror. The only thing it has in common with a mirror is the name, otherwise it's just a shiney surface, which, I guess, is ok, since it's a safety mirror on a toy.
POSITIVE	This product is wonderful for your child to learn there ABC's. My son loved playing with these. He also likes to stack the letters and put them in a row on the refridgerator. Excellent Product!!!!!!!!!
NEGATIVE	Bought this after reading the other reviews. Someone said the acting was good... Someone said the effects were good... My experience was quite the opposite. The set up was intriguing but the acting was mediocre and with one or two of the actors actually laughable. So bad it's funny kind of thing. Honestly I felt very disappointed with the movie. There are so many better ones out there for your money.
POSITIVE	Wondering how to perk up a hurting friend or family member? Beyond Casseroles has great ideas to make anyone smile. Some suggestions are simple and some have you combing flea markets and garage sales. This book has something for anyone who wants to bring cheer into someone elses life, even their own.Choices: Managing Chronic Pain
NEGATIVE	This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There was nothing funning about it. A complete waste of time...
POSITIVE	I tend to not appreciate fiction. I read a lot of brain candy as a child, but one day in my early teens I picked up this book.1) I met William F. Buckley, Jr.2) I saw revolutionaries from a different angle.3) I developed a desire to read books with substance.4) I was innoculated against Steinbeck.It's engaging fiction that young people can enjoy. Let them get a little bit of this perspective before their pinko profs get them.
NEGATIVE	Was suppose to work on XP, could not get to download. Got warnig of incompatable. Not happy with this product
POSITIVE	If you don't want to spend a lot of money, this is a great little stereo plus woofer system.
POSITIVE	"One of my all time favorites, this album just aches with sadness and depression. It's a shame this was the end for them, and that nothing any member has done since comes close to what Lowercase accomplished. ""Kill the Lights"" is fantastic too...Unwound fans take note."
NEGATIVE	This game was another disapointment for the XBox.The good:1) You can run into anything2) The cars are fastThe moderate:1) Storyline is dumb, and uninteresting2) Characters are ditzy, and totally uninteresting3) Some unique missionsThe bad:1) Graphics that look PS2, not XBox quality2) The game is boring after 30 minutes3) A totally indestructable vehicleRent it, DO NOT BUY THIS TITLE.
NEGATIVE	I have been sewing for thirty years and this is by far the worst instruction book I have ever bought. Unclear instructions were bad, but then at least there was some light comedy- in the spelling errors. Who proof read this book???
POSITIVE	As an editor, I have shelves of books on the subject. This book remains my favorite. Once you get bored with editing books that read like a high school grammer, check this book out. It brings you to a more refined level of editing.
POSITIVE	"One of the best old Hollywood reads. Ordering a new copy 30 yrs later. Very good funny stories.So is "" The moons. A Ballon""."
NEGATIVE	I used to own the vinyl version. It made a lovely ashtry.Seriously: SKIP THIS ALBUM. I own almost every album by Dylan, but I threw this one away. Literally.Dylan was in this period apparently possessed by his born-again christian mania, and his lyrics are intolerant, didactic, humorless, and smug.Absolutely without a doubt his very worst album EVER. He's recorded over 40 other albums so far... start with ANYTHING ELSE.
POSITIVE	A variety of knives for your everyday kitchen use. Although it says dishwasher safe, a few have already had a bit of rusty spots on them.
NEGATIVE	On initial opening I was very pleased with this watch. The fake vintage-ness of it looked great. However, after having worn it for a few days its flaws became very apparent.The most noticeable flaw is the over sized crown. It looks great but constantly comes loose because it's too large. This causes it to stop time on the watch, and with enough wrist movement, winds the hands back and forth. At least once a day I have to reset the time. What use is a watch that can't keep time?Then I accidentally dropped the watch while putting it on one day. It was no more then 4 feet off the ground and now the hands are motionless and the crown doesn't function. Any decently built watch should be able to survive a short drop on carpet.Don't waste your money.
POSITIVE	"This book picks up where The Whorehouse left off. More biting and piercing but less scatalogical in many ways. I loved the ride the ""The Whore"" gave me but ""The Slut"" bumps and grinds her hips where ""The Whore"" stopped. Highly recommend this book. But not for the easily offended or weak of mind,"
POSITIVE	I have used B-V for 40 years now i can't find it I'm at a loss. it was made by Wilson years ago can anyone help Me find it.
NEGATIVE	Amazing Irv doesn't deserve the title. The only trick in this book worth practising is the levitation, it is basically the classic baldacci levitiation, re-popularised by David Blaine and shown on his recent tv special. Other than that forget it. You would be better off with Karl Fulves Selfworking table magic - 97 fool proof tricks, as these require no set up, faked props or - most important, accomplices (i mean, it's hard enough finding friends nowdays let alone stooges). Oh yeah, Diamond Jim, when are you going to republish Pocketfull of Miracles ?Sometime soon I hope.
NEGATIVE	This thing shrieks at a decibel level that could probably kill a small animal. Unfortunately it doesn't actually clean that much. Brushes go around pretty good but the vacuum doesn't seem to really understand its job.
POSITIVE	I got this camera for my birthday, it works really well! Not very expensive, takes [usually] clean photos, but lighting can sometimes be difficult. Video is good, but no sound. =(Good for teenagers, if it's lost/broken you're not out a lot of money, small enough to keep with you, easy to use, and great for pictures of you & friends. I would definetly recommend it.(PS, we got one for my grandpop's birthday too, and he understands the basics. Not hard to learn)
POSITIVE	When I first started reading this book, I was totally convinced that I should put it back on the library shelf. But after I got past the more boring chapters, I got to a book combining the traditional time travel with the world of a young orphan boy. For those who want a plesant change in reading, try KING OF SHADOWS.
NEGATIVE	I NEVER write product reviews, but I just had to with this item. Be advised that (according to Sierra online support) you DO NOT get everything listed on the box--LandDesigner, PhotoGarden Designer and Garden Encyclopedia are the only products you'll receive software for. You WILL NOT get Designer Garden Library or Landscape Design Guide. I wrote support three times on this and the fact that I can't seem to go back to fix the windows I added to my house, and received curt, insufficient answers days after I submitted them. I'm considering sending this product back, but I haven't seen another with reviews that were much better. I'm very frustrated and wish you better luck with your software purchase.
NEGATIVE	We tried to use this several times with my daughter (now 5 months old)and she screamed each time. I kept thinking that maybe she was too little, but the carrier just never held her properly. She always seemed to be too low in the carrier and she would want to chew on the straps. I thought that she just may not like carriers, but I bought the Bjorn and she abosolutely loves it! Now that we have used both, there are some serious differences in the way the baby is held and this carrier just does not get it done - at least for us. Also - the difference in the back pressure is unreal...this one really did hurt my back and she is only 14.4 lbs.
POSITIVE	"Product works as intended and great price, but really pi$$es me off when you get a brown box recycled item after you order a ""Original HP LaserJet 27X Black Print Cartridge in Retail Packaging - Dual Pack"" and the pretty HP box is shown in the ad.So far so good, no problems with product itself yet. Been using it for about 6 months now, very low duty cycle, so I have toner for a while.So.... what's the deal with all this?"
POSITIVE	When my son opened the case,Ghost Recon 2 wasn't inside it,but another game.I was disappointed,but he likes the other games so I guess is well that ends well
NEGATIVE	"I bought it a couple of years ago looking at the cover but was extremely disappointed when my 18-month old insisted on ""Mickey"" today and I chucked it into my DVD player. Our baby started crying aloud suggesting ""what is this rap?"" Disney folks ought to know better not try and market elevator music for 70-year olds to little toddlers regardless of how fantasia the cover looks like!"
POSITIVE	I really enjoyed reading this book!! Karen Hesse does a wonderful job of pulling the reader into the 1930's. Her description of life in the dust bowl during the Great Depression allow the reader to feel all of the emotions of the characters and taste the dust during the storms. I wish that she would have provided more information at the end of the book. After experiencing all of Billie's sorrows and triumphs I was disappointed to find that there was no more story to read. I would recommend this book to my friends and I'm giving my grandfather a copy to read.
POSITIVE	i have bought a couple toys from this company they are so lifelike and real its amazing! this company is great, my order was here the next day too, and i only asked for regular shipping, everything about it is GREAT !
POSITIVE	I have been a fan of the backstreet boys since I was 14 years old...I'm now 21 and I bought Nick's album pretty much as a obligation because I still like the boys. What I didn't expect was an absolutely amazing album with tracks that you just can't get out of your head...and I'm not even a rock music fan! Plus the album isn't totally rock music. You will love it trust me..go and get it!..Oh ya the DVD is really good too, so if you wanna get the DVD you have to hurry becasue it isn't gonna be in all the CDs.
POSITIVE	Very good one of Ministy's best.I never get tired of listening to World ,The best Ministry in years
NEGATIVE	This book was as useless as the German version of Strarwars that I received on Amazon
POSITIVE	With the Mechwarrior games being my only Simulation experience, I bought this one mainly for the cool pictures on the box. For once, they did justice to the frosty disc within. Playing Lt. Casey, you fly missions against a strange invading foe, intent on extinguishing all life they find. Spanning three discs, I lost count of the missions I flew. I was so involved, I actually jumped when I was blown up! I've never played a game that left me shaking afterwards...this one grabs you by the neck, wrings you out, and leaves you exhausted but wanting more. Keeping it from 5 stars is a small glitch that makes the mouse pointer travel across the screen by itself, making menu items difficult to choose at times. A small flaw indeed, but an annoying one.
NEGATIVE	The quality of these tablets seemed very poor. I noticed one of the tablets was about half the size of the others and decided not to take it. I think good quality allergy medicine is important so I went back to the brand name Benadryl and other generics that I trust more. I returned this.
POSITIVE	I recently bought the DVD version of this and I find it amazing. I have only been a wrestling fan for the past 2 years now and this DVD showed a lot of the old matches that I had never seen. It had a lot of history for some of the WWF superstars and highlights of their careers and their rise to stardom. Defiantly a must buy item for any WWF fan.
NEGATIVE	Upon first removing it from the box I noticed that the set felt very fragile and it was. The cup broke (from a very slight bump) the first time I washed it, making the set useless. The top part, the teapot, is not very attractive on it's own and it dribbles when you pour it, so you can't really use it anywhere you don't want to mop up spilled tea. For me, this is a very disappointing waste of money.
POSITIVE	fixodent fresh is exactly what i ordered, cost a lot more than walmart, but was a lot easier to buy from amazon
POSITIVE	I love this book and refer to it often. It is about the worst of you as a lover. OMG it is spit your drink out funny! And for all the people that I know also very true.
POSITIVE	"""Broadway Danny Rose"" is an often forgotten very nostalgic and very funny Woody Allen film. I have not seen it in years but there was something very special about it. I remember that it was great to see Sandy Baron in the film. Where was he all those years? This showbiz comedy is as dry and witty as they come and there is a lot of truth and honesty behind it all. Perhaps that's why it has always remained special to me."
NEGATIVE	"I started reading this guy's stuff only recently, 2011. He is fine but it is so clear that he is now getting paid by the page and has no editor that reading his stuff is getting boring. He uses stuff like Tom Clancy does, ""inside"" names for weapons systems, and the tired old reference to ""Langley."" Anyone else notice the recurring theme to spy novels is to always blame everything on that darn old Langley? Tired of it. Vince, get an editor or program to get rid of your overuse of words like ""grab,"" and phrases like ""more than qualified."" Good for you that you get paid by the pound now but it's tiring."
NEGATIVE	This is not a good product. The hose loses its spiral integrity by only stepping on it. The metal connect is cutting into the hose only after a few uses. This is a $7 china special.
NEGATIVE	"Please check out ""God Calling"" instead! There's no comparison between the two, except that ""Come Away My Beloved"" seems inauthentic in comparison. ""Come Away My Beloved"" is one person's imagination about what God might be saying, while ""God Calling"" is an authentic representation of what God's saying. Trust me on this one!"
POSITIVE	Drake Dreldragon Douay. Now that's a heroes hero. Real, powerful, flawed and by far the most talented liar on all of stokos. This novel is a stand alone that can be enjoyed even without owning or reading the other chronicles. Aquire it at any cost
POSITIVE	"Friends have been trying to get me to read Harlan Coben for years. Finally did it, and man, am I glad I did! This guy (Coben)is good and his protagonist (Bolitar) is even better..good stuff, can't wait to read the whole Bolitar series...this book is a quick, easy and fascinating read...unusual twist at the end, but I understand that is part of reading and loving Coben...Myron Bolitar ranks rank up there with Mitch Rapp (Vince Flynn) and John Corey (Nelson DeMille) ..different genres perhaps, but every bit as good..every bit as good.....""Promise Me"" keeps moving on every page and keeps you moving right along with it."

NEGATIVE	"I have loved Bohjalian's books, every one of them until this one. He really dropped the ball in this novel, as did his editor who allowed all of the parenthetical asides that interrupted any flow he might have established in the narrative. The characters were vapid and unappealing, so unlike the persons of depth readers usually find. The plot was contrived and tedious. It was always a pleaure to learn from Bohjalian's work about a subject totally unfamiliar and surprisingly interesting, like midwifery or alternative medicine or transexuality. The FERAL people were consistently annoying and extreme to a fault. Their abrasive stance made Spencer's ""accident"" seem a just dessert for someone so narrow- minded and controlling. I am hopeful that, having purged this novel from his system, Bohjalian will write another that returns him to the ranks of outstanding contemporary authors."
POSITIVE	"For me, Noah Gordon has created a ""time machine"" in The Physician. In its pages I am transported to northern europe's darkest hours. I can almost feel the misty mornings and smell the muddy roads along which a ""touched"" boy trods, searching for his place in a threatening world. We are offered a well developed and supported transformation from the young man's early survival years to his life-making, heart-wrenching commitment to the art of healing. Along the way, we witness many fascinating points relating the beliefs and practices of Judaism. The historical points are well-researched and well-placed.The pace of The Physician slowed just long enough for me to take a deep breath - now and then - and jump back in! The ending made sense and felt good to me. So much so that I located and purchased Mr. Gordon's other books! If they are near to The Physician's satisfying read, I'll be very happy indeed!"
NEGATIVE	i have read many reviews of this movie which say how great it is, blah blah. well what a disappointment. it is an example of a movie on a sensitive subject matter that mainstream media figures can't bash, simply because it would somehow by association be construed as them marginalizing the subject matter. this movie blows.
NEGATIVE	"I allways loved Sting's music since he left The Police. His ability to put together the best musicians in the world, his beautiful melodies and odd time signatures (always ""making it swing"") were unique. It WAS more than just POP music. This album is unfortunately the worst thing he has ever done. It's just a comercial product. We (fans all over the world) will be waiting for a more meaningfull record."
NEGATIVE	"Unless you were a child prodigy who could read the Fountain Head and Naked Lunch in two to three days, play a part in the Rocky Horror Picture Show and discuss the meaning of life and death among other things at your teacher's house at the age of fourteen, then this will not be the book for you. This author is in wonderland if he expects any average person (and it doesn't even matter what click or scene you were in while in high school) to believe or relate to this story. The story at times became way too ""cute"" and kind of left the story shallow and unrealistic. Overall not a bad book and even some decent music references but if you are of a certain age and have somewhat of a grasp of reality, you probably won't buy into this book."
POSITIVE	Not like I really know what ecstacy is supposed to be anyways, but this album certainly puts you in the euphoric mood where you wouldn't care! 'Change' is a sure moodlifter and 'Home' is perfect as its complement to inject a little reality into life. Playfullness parried with harsh realities is the best way to described Sheryl Crow. Every coin has two sides and music that shows just one of those sides doesn't fit into the scheme of things. Sheryl's music definitely fits and she's set for a bright future.I wouldn't necessarily call the album grittier or poetry. Its definitely no concept album and the cuts don't relate much to each other except in style. The songs are meant to individually take you on a ride - and when the album's done you wanna get back in line and do it over again!May take a while to grow on you - since her style is unique. The good part is that its enjoyment is not short-lived; I've been enjoying it for a year now.Highly Recommended!!
POSITIVE	This is truly a wonderful piece of work by Woody Russell. If you love music which is truly timeless, you should own this CD. This artist has stayed true to his roots and not sold out for commercial success, which is a good thing for the true music lover. Time To Go blends tight guitar playing with wonderful story telling to create a gem worthy of listening to over and over. Russell envokes emotion from his guitar, and you will feel every note. Edgy at times (Been So Good to Me.com), soul searching at others (Gone), but always passionate. My favorite song is the one I'm listening to at the time. Hopefully, we will not have to wait 3 more years before being blessed with another album from Woody Russell.
NEGATIVE	"Sorry, but it is time for someone to utter a discouraging word. The only value to this album comes from reminding us of what was, and sending us back to the old vinyl. Sometimes, immitation indeed is the sincerest form of flattery. Other times, it just should not be done. Like here.These songs were better the first time around. ""Walk Away Renee"", ""Ask The Lonely"", and most of the others recorded here just don't hold a candle to the originals. And only in the interest of historical accuracy, to gently correct another reviewer, ""It's In His Kiss"" was recorded by Betty Everett fifteen years before Cher did (you could look it up!)Like Manilow singing Sinatra, of the aforementioned Bolton singing Percy Sledge, some things should just not be done."
NEGATIVE	I love the show, I've seen all the episodes, but when I saw that the 1st season was going to be released uncensored, I was waiting for the release date. I bought the DVD and still heard more bleeps than punch lines and the musical performances were cut out for no reason.Sister company Comedy Central: Dave Chepelle season's all have complete musical performances. (No copy right laws if that's what your thinking)Biggest disappointment: Can't return DVD's.
NEGATIVE	I just took this phone back to Best Buy. I had the same battery problem and mine quit accessing the network about a week ago. I could still call but no XL. BB let me use 29 credit on an 8610 cause it was past 30 days.
NEGATIVE	I bought this for my mother, who loves eating crushed ice. It worked great for approximately 4 months and then the motor locked up and it stopped working. I'll order a more heavy duty one in the future.
NEGATIVE	I found this book not to be a good investment. It is an extraction of certain SSA publications, all available in user-friendly format at the official SSA website. The major drawback is that the tables of values for benefits and earnings limits stop at the year 2002. The edition I received in January, 2003 is the third edition dated May, 2002. While the content is current to 2002 and the SSA regulations may not have changed substantially, it is not helpful for referencing 2003 numbers and beyond.
NEGATIVE	The frame is silverish paint over black pastic.The Dial is much more modern with sanserif numbers.It posesses a conventional movement with the second hand concentric to the others.The backlight is insufficient to read past 10 feet at night by my eyes.The backlighting is a timer set for up to eight hours starting when you first adjust it. The light does not come on with reduced light levels.Mine both arrived with a hazing of the crystal. [Shop wear?]David Bullis
POSITIVE	very good book. keeps your interest and links from the 1st book very well. the characters were well developed and the story line was good. There was the main story line and a sub story line as well. the book kept them current w/ each other and linked them well and in a way that followed well with the story. i loved the interplay of Val con and Meri. the book showed their human side as well as there expertise in their own fields.
POSITIVE	I think that Walker, Texas Ranger is an ok show but to my uncle it's heaven! Not to mention he think's he's the Texas Ranger and so for him he loves this series!!!
POSITIVE	Kids love this movie, and everything to do with it. I bought one for my nephew, one for a 4 year old male little friend of ours, and one for my 3 & 7 year old daughters... They all love it! Our friend even carried it around, and was saying how he was real... because he was so big! Too cute!
NEGATIVE	I have gotten this shaver as a replacement for an old Hitachi. What a disappointment. The shaver's battery is terrible. I barely get 3 or 4 shaves out of it. Also, I don't use this shaver every day, so it could be the idle time drains the battery too. Also, you can't just plug it in, and start using the shaver. Power can only come from the battery, so you can't bypass it (a real bummer when the shaver is low on juice). Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the ergonomics to be too bad. The other problem is that it takes a while to shave as well, it's slow. I got fed up, and got a Panasonic instead (and it was only forty bucks). MUCH MUCH better. I charged it once, and it's still going strong. Save your money and get a better product.
NEGATIVE	Virtually every track of this recording is distorted due to what must have been excessive gain during the recording. Shame, otherwise a pretty good performance.
NEGATIVE	I purchased this book thinking it was the one I needed for my Berklee Class, but realized it was the outdated edition only after it arrived and my classes had begun. This is the second edition, the third edition is available directly from Berklee.
POSITIVE	"Reads like a novel. I didn't know much about Karen Blixen before, but I couldn't stop reading this book. I liked the movie ""Out of Africa"" a lot, and I enjoyed learning the true story behind her life. I see now why they wanted to make a film about her; her life was as good as fiction."
POSITIVE	I'm a regular exerciser who wasn't looking forward to slowing down when I got pregnant, but figured I'd buy a yoga DVD and do my best. At first it was interesting but a little slow. Then I started having premature contractions and got put on modified bedrest. My doctor said I couldn't exercise at all but after a week of that my muscles (and my brain) got very twitchy and restless. Now I've started to do this yoga DVD again and it's gentle enough to ease my restlessness and doesn't cause any contractions. I think it's saving my sanity and keeping my baby healthy to boot!
NEGATIVE	I didn't purchase this on the amazon website, but through a local pet suppy store. I was so excited until I actually tried to put this on my bike. To sum it up the metal parts were VERY, VERY poorly tooled. At first I thought I might have bought a defective item, so I took it back to the store. When I opened the second one I was shocked to see the same problem. The nuts were all scratched up and would barely fit over the bolts. The large nut only fit after about half a can of wd40 and A LOT of elbow grease from my boyfriend (LAME! because I am strong and shouldn't have to ask somebody to do it for me). I finally had it all attached and took my dog for a ride around the neighborhood. That part was okay. When I came home I tried to remove the pin, so I could ride my bike without the attachment. The pin would not come out! I had to take my bike apart to take this stupid thing off. Then I had to pound the pin with a mallot to remove it.Really really lame...
POSITIVE	Spy Kids has awakened the child inside me, due to the good inocent humor and cartoonish, non-lethal family film.The director Robert Rodriguez has shown one more time his creativity and good humor.Antonio Banderas has proved that he really is a good actor in kind of movie roles. Also Carla Gugino is fantastic in her role as a good mom who always takes good care of her family.Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara have grow up since their last movie. They have not, however, lost there inocence and are still cute.As the mother of two kids (from Los angeles), I would encourege you to add this movie to your colection.
POSITIVE	It is a good moovie, but the old one is better. The problem is, surpassing Audrey Hepburn's breath-taking beauty is a mission impossible. God made only one Hepburn.
POSITIVE	Nicholas Sparks took me on a fabulous journey to discover the truth about love in uncommon places. His poise of writing amazes me as he so vividly describes to us the love between Landon and Jamie.Landon Carter was heading into trouble in his senior year. Until the night of the dance, when he doesn't have anyoune to go with, so he invites the reverend's daughter, good girl, Jamie Sullivan. Through a series of events, Landon finds himself in love with her. But, unknown to him, she has a secret that could affect his life forever. This book truly is a walk to remember. I would recommend reading the book before seeing the movie, due to Hollywood, some of Sparks' genius is not in the movie. Read this book and you will not regret it.
POSITIVE	"Imagine that it's a warm Friday evening in the Summertime and you're feeling great. You've just had the best week of your life. You're sitting in an intimate nightclub, across from you is the most beautiful woman you've ever been with and she just told you she thinks she is falling in love with you. Now imagine the music in that nightclub. It will be Slim Man.Some refer to this music as ""Smooth Jazz"" even though that has gotten a negative rap from pure jazz enthusiasts. But if you like that style, even a little, you owe it to yourself to get this CD. To coin a phrase, ""No one does it better"" than Slim Man. The music, performance, and recording are all perfect. And don't stop with just this one CD. All of his work is as near perfect as can be."
NEGATIVE	Scott Stapp is not Eddie Vedder, or Jim Morrison, or a good singer or songwriter. I wish he would spit that golfball out of his mouth. Please look elsewhere for musical entertainment.
NEGATIVE	I read over 150 pages of this book and it was a struggle all the way. I was thoroughly disappointed with this selection. Impossible to make sense of the characters, the story was boring...and I never finished it.. I figure that reading is suppose to be a pleasurable experience. As I look at the other reviews I can see I am not alone.
POSITIVE	Billy Graham's story is told here in a very wonderful way !!! He is one of , if the best , preacher of our Father's word in the last century !!!
NEGATIVE	The item received in a very bad shape, damaged and broken. We are having a hard time getting our money back now
POSITIVE	This is similar to every other cat toy out there. But for some reason it's the ONLY one my cats want to play with. I don't get it, but it's worth it for them to get their exercise! It holds up reasonably well, for a cat toy meant for destruction.
POSITIVE	I have sensitivities to sulfates in shampoos. This shampoo has solved my problems. Because it is sulfate free it won't lather up as much as typical shampoos, because of this is also doesn't strip natural oils out of hair. It leaves the moisture in my hair while cleaning it. It has a natural light citrus scent that isn't overly perfumey like a lot of shampoos. Great for Curly hair!
NEGATIVE	Ok, the lyrics are catchy, and I like them, like, a lot. But man, they can't write tunes worth a shit! For good punk crap buy NOFX. They're cool. Punk in Drublic rocks unlilke SOME bands' CDs.
POSITIVE	This replaces the one I had for years. Other than a change in the case color (mine is red, not blue), it's exactly the same.
POSITIVE	Hopefully she was able to make perfect pasta. She is a doctor who loves to cook, so should be easy for her to figure out.
NEGATIVE	Dispicable...truly NOT funny, truly VERY annoying. I hated seeing it in my apartment so bad that I had to do the next best thing....put it in a waffle maker, then the toaser, then the oven, then douse it in lighter fluid and light. That was the most exciting part of the dvd.
NEGATIVE	"Daniel Lopes ""enjoys"" tragic fame in Germany. He almost won the first German pop idol series but then got so much negative press that there was no chance anymore. His debut solo song ""Shine on"" was produced by Frank Farian and is a rather weak effort. One wonders how Frank Farian could give him such a weak song. This could have worked out much better for Daniel - with another song."
NEGATIVE	"The only problem with this book, is that it isn't true. Some research into the story shows how much the facts were twisted to suit a liberal agenda or some other twisted revisionist ploy at the expense to history. Although the author claims it is a ""novel,"" he also implies that it is well founded in the facts, which it is not in many regards. DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!!"
POSITIVE	It's got concerts, interviews, videos, the making of the videos, and Nick, AJ, Brian, Howie, and Kevin just goofing around. It gives you a good idea about how videos shoots are done and how the concerts go.
NEGATIVE	I am an RN and I was trying to find a cheaper stethescope, which I learned (again) was a bad choice! I ordered this sprague and it came with the box intact - but only one of the earpeices produced sound! Now I have to go through the hassle of sending it back. at least amazon reimbursed me for the shipping!
POSITIVE	I really enjoy this game. The commentators are great. The graphics are pretty good. One problem is that whenever they put the screen on a game-cam and then press A, the screen turns blurry. Most of the time, the game seems quite realistic. This is my first football game of this type. We have no other gaming systems besides the Wii.
POSITIVE	I love this CD. Maybe, we can't compare this opera with Don Giovanni, Cosi Fan Tutte or the Magic Flute; written when Mozart was older; but all the musicians in this album are fantastic. Then, we can say that this is one of the bests versions of The Abduction from the Serail that I ever listened. The sound is perfect and all the elements are in the right position. It's hardly recomended for all kind of classical music lovers.
POSITIVE	Having had a few like this one before It is a major upgrade in the sound department. But... It isn't 100% silent. The only time it makes noise is a slight popping noise as soon as it turns on and off.If it wasn't for the pop when it turns on and off during automatic temp mode I would have given it a perfect rating.
POSITIVE	I hear that this disc is no longer available. That's a shame. I really like this disc and purchased it after seeing Boo and Darden Smith live and listening to their CD -Evidence. Boo has some great tunes and wonderful backing musicians on this one. The Discovery lable must have gone out of print. Too bad.
NEGATIVE	"I invested $6.00 for what I assumed to be an insightful article on Behavior Modification versus medication for kids with ADHD. What I got was 1 1/2 pages of pretty meaningless statistics that related to only one particular drug, methylphenidate (Ritalin)--- no info. on Adderall ---, administered over a summer camp period, with a ""caveat"" that ""almost all the children had been previously medicated before enrollment in the summer study"" (conducted by a doctor who was a consultant and grant recipient for several major drug compnies). Do yourself a favor, spend your $6 on a couple of coffee drinks and just Google: ""Behavior modification ADHD"" for a whole lot of FREE and USEFUL information. I wonder who is actually making a profit on this, shame on him/her!"
POSITIVE	dis album is mint!woteva sort of music u like ull like dis it has sumat 4 evry1. da songs r so real n r obviously from experience n dats cool!so go buy it cos u'll love it!
NEGATIVE	This unit looks and feels like a toy, the underarm sensor is hard to use and too big for a newborn - it was impossible to get a good reading (which also takes ages). Ultimately, just don't trust this product, feels like something you'd get from a joke shop.
POSITIVE	True, there are some alterations from the original version, but this is still a wonderful movie. The voice acting definitely carries the movie. The storyline is an old plot nicely augmented by Disney. Bravo!
POSITIVE	Aunque toda la obra de Garcia Marquez es brillante, considero que Ojos de Perro Azul goza de las caracteristicas de un cuento perfecto. Es magico e inesperado. Transporta al lector a un mundo de ensueño que se va revelando sutilmente. Definitivamente, vale la pena leerlo, mas de una vez.
POSITIVE	"A must-have book on trading. Why? It really forces you to think for yourself. To paraphrase a well-know fishing analogy, teach someone a system, they trade for a while...help someone to think and they can trade for a lifetime.And trade is the key word, you are not investing, etc, but placing your psyche and cash on the line. Each of the ""rules"" gives you the chance to think through a critical concept and come to grips with what can work with you.Each ""rule"" is clearly and concisely developed. No BS or watered-down drivel. Each is consistent within the larger picture.I could write more for you to read here, but your time would be much better spent reading Jankovsky's 28 Rules for yourself."
POSITIVE	I agree with all the above praise. The book was meticulously researched and well written. Great personal recollections from the people who were there.There were two minor annoyances1. The author repeats himself fairly often.2. You get bounced back and forth in time a bit. From pre-prohibition to post and then to the 90's then back to WWII.Minor issues that probably won't bother you unless you're reading the book on and off over the course of a couple of weeks.
POSITIVE	"I've always been a fan of Sean Hannity from listening to him on the radio, and his book, ""Let Freedom Ring,"" just enforces my good thoughts on the guy. He speaks sensibly and is sure not to sound too arrogant, while at the same time, powerfully asserting his political beliefs. I don't know how he does it.Thanks, Sean!"
NEGATIVE	This fax machine needs a babysitter. It cannot be trusted to fax without trying to eat the pages and jam constantly. You have to stand over it, and guide the pages straight so they don't get pulled in crooked. And it is LOUD!! VERY LOUD!! I dream of taking this machine out to the field, pulling out a baseball bat and going all OFFICE SPACE on it!!!!
NEGATIVE	"This is not music. This is just something to shape today's Fuse-watching teens.If you used to like good charlotte but now you consider it poser music, you might like this.If you think metrosexual/bisexual goth/emo guys in tight pants and eyeliner and boys kissing boys is extremely sexy, you might like this.If you hang with an extremely trendy crowd who loves drugs and drinking and lip rings and each kid trying to be more hardcore than the next, you might like this.Good news: You might get over this""All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly."""
POSITIVE	I love this duffle!!! The bottom compartment is a great place to store shoes, ski boots etc. Main compartment is roomy has 2 elastic stash pockets and a mesh pocket above- perfect for under clothes. The 2 side pockets are roomy enough to store toiletries plus any other items you'd like to take along. This bag is the perfect solution for a weekend out of town.
POSITIVE	The romance is surprising, tender, and exciting; the story keeps you guessing until the last few pages. The drama and mystery make it seem more like a thriller than a romance novel, which make the romantic scenes even better when they show up. She is smart and independant; he is strong, clever, witty, and charming without being too rehearsed.
POSITIVE	I ordered the re manufactured Samsung SyncMaster 930s to run with another I already had as a duel screen set up. I wanted the same look on both screens so this worked out great. Both my old unit and this new one function flawlessly and for the price are great products. The merchant got the screen right to me in good time with no problem.If still available, I would recommend this item for the budget minded user.
NEGATIVE	I haven't really gotten that far in the book yet but it seems to be thought provoking. Looking forward to finishing it!
POSITIVE	I am a BIG Stephen King fan! I have read such books as The Dark Half, Carrie, Cugo, Christine, and The Shining. The Dark Half started out a little slow then picked up lots of speed that built up to the climax. I thought the ending could have been better and just a little bit more realistic. This book is pretty intense, and has a lot of gore!! But over all this book is very good!!
POSITIVE	I had a chance to tape this movie on Swiss Televion last weekend, and watched twice, the first time I was ah and oh, and could not believe what I had just watched, so I watched it a second time fully through and had the greatest laugh. I don't want to give anything away, however I recommand to watch the movie until the credits are over, then you will have the greatest laugh. - To bad the docu is currently not available on DVD.
NEGATIVE	"I read this book when it first came out, and immediately recognized that the characters and plot were not original, but stolen. Others did as well, and it didn't take long for the truth to come out:""Crane's Morning"" is one of the most infamous examples of plagiarism in existence. The entire plot, as well as huge chunks of exact, word-for-word dialog and description, were copied from ""The Rosemary Tree"" by Elizabeth Goudge. All that the ""author"" did was move the setting from England to India.The book was withdrawn from publication, and all unsold copies returned to the publisher, when the theft was discovered."
NEGATIVE	The product came with three identical CD Keys, which means I cannot play the game after installation. I had read about this issue before, but thought I was in the clear when the game installed without any problem. Atari support is difficult to contact, and requires picture evidence to get corrected keys. That would be alright, except that their online form does not allow for attachments! This is the last Atari product I will ever buy, and I hope Amazon stops selling this before Atari is able to work this out.
NEGATIVE	"I am also an Alice collector and I agree with you wholeheartedly except for one thing. An amazing version of Alice in Wonderland DOES exist...""Alice"" by Jan Svankmajer (1988). It's not 100% accurate to the book, but it captures the madness beautifully. The two stars I've given this TV version are for the nice visuals in some scenes."
POSITIVE	Short but inspiring,this young Japanese woman has written an original a gem, as her name.Clearly defined, reality based; she takes us on a spiritual journey. A journey so intimate and personal, that at times I felt; subconciously;I was intruding.We all relate in some fashion, because of the commonality of life itself...family, faith, death, loneliness, desertion.One's explanation of home and the memories of a special person in a kitchen that would have to sustain her for a lifetime. While reminding us of the persistence of time, the process of survival, and the unexpected relationships built along the way. The realization that life is a journey to be lived and not resolved. Ultimately, lessons she would learn, while her inner-strength prevailed.Extremely tender and sincere, it touched apon my own sense of loss. Giving me back memories of my dear grandmother and all the special moments we shared together in her kitchen.
POSITIVE	If you change your own oil on a small fleet of vehicles, than owning a nice oil filter wrench is a must. So far, these pliers have worked great. I used to cuss and fuss trying to get oil filters loose and this wrench has taken the hassle out of trying to get filters off. This is way better than a strap wrench or trying to use that little hex head on the filter itself.Great product!
POSITIVE	Seriously best show ever. Such amazing acting. I watched all the episodes within a week. Just rewatched it again. Can't wait for it to come back!
POSITIVE	one of the best cd's i have heard you just have to hear this one from start to finish good story great beats and rhymes worth double what it costs
POSITIVE	The sixth edition has continued to live up to its name. It is indeed a 'Visual Quickstart Guide.' Unlike other books, it presents clear and concise instructions, and no lengthy text. Everything is delivered in point forms. Useful tips are sprinkled over the text here and there as well.It can also serve as a quick reference tool that is easy to look up to. The appendices consists of the following: some commonly used (X)HTML elements and attributes, CSS properties and values, and some javascipt events. It is definitely worth it to own a copy of it.It is a beginner's book and it offers more than enough to get you a decent layout for your web pages. Ideal for any novice designer to wants get productive fast.
POSITIVE	A warning to compiler practitioners: This book is heavily based on mathematics. Ideas are expressed more often as algebra and theorems than as English prose. Therefore it's more of a resource for academic work than for actually implementing a compiler. If you are looking for such a formal treatment, perhaps as the basis of a thesis, I highly recommend this book. It's similar to the Dragon Book, but is more up to date and covers topics specific to imperative, functional, logic, and OO languages. But if you're simply interested in getting a working understanding of how to implement a compiler, I suggest one of the other highly rated works on Amazon. I think the other reviewer (only 2 reviews says something too) summarized it best: authoritative, informative, and dull.
NEGATIVE	Nice idea but it blew out the fuses in my car. Avoid. Save money by paying more for a unit that doesn't cause problems and/or has better documentation.
NEGATIVE	The research is poor or non existant. The theories are based on speculation with no science to back up anything. A waste of time and money
POSITIVE	Im sure anyone who has gotten this far has heard the anecdote about everyone who has bought a VU record started a band. The fact of the matter is, even if you buy a record because it is influential, you wont listen to it unless it is good. This album is better than good. Every song here sounds like it could have been written in the last 10 years. Even the more avant-garde tracks, once played to annoy club owners, sound good by todays standards. This is a classic and an absolute must have.
POSITIVE	"There are a lot of dumb, goofy girly songs on here, but it has some raw ones too (like ""Safety First"")... way better than the rest of the crap on KRS."
NEGATIVE	I would like to start by saying I love Tetris and have been playing for years! That is why I felt it needful to tell all weary of this game to seak other games as options. The downfalls are greater for an older aged generation down-pitted with cheezy annoying music and lame Attari like graphics. As for a younger group of Tetris players this may just pass as fun.
POSITIVE	I highly recomend this book to anyone interested in learning,preaching or just spreading the word of the Lord.It is extremly usefull in aiding in research of topics of discussion.
NEGATIVE	Having heard the general plot of this movie and knowing the Allies had had at least two events which followed the plot, I expected this movie in some way to relate to reality. I guess the director decided that real war would not sell tickets. The movie is complete fantasy. The choice was made to use a few facts, which serves to confuse the audience. Kubrick, Spielburg, and other skilled directors have proven war flicks can be realistic, interesting, and exciting. I found this movie completely lacking in the first two criteria.
NEGATIVE	What a bunch of crap, I bought it because it said it had over 60 minutes of new footage. The length in time for both movies was the same as the VHS editions.Very big disappointment
POSITIVE	i read this book when i was in fifth grade, and my teacher mr. tolerton introduced my class to it. I remember we wrote a letter to mrs. julie edwards and we were all so surprised to find out that she was really julie andrews! for the past 9 years, i know that book has crossed my mind over and over again. i would just like to reccomend it to anyone who wants to read a good story-no matter what the age, just open up your mind and have fun!
NEGATIVE	"Like all of Clancy's books, this one is dull, and predictable. He puts so much time into his research(though I truly doubt it on this one!) that he forgets he is writing a thriller to entertain his readers. When he started getting paid per word, his quality of writing took a nose dive, to the point where his stories are formulaic, and unimaginative.Read instead; Larry Bond's1. Red Pheonix(2nd Korean War)2. Vortex(South Africa)3. Cauldron(Turmoil in Western Europe)David Hagberg's ""By Dawn's Early Light"" and ""Kilo Option(written under the name of Sean Flannery)Grant Blackwood's ""Wall of Night""All of the novels listed above are far Superior to ANYTHING authored by Clancy since his ""RED STORM RISING""(co-authored with Larry Bond).Each of these novelists could teach Clancy a lot about writing Techno-THRILLERS."
POSITIVE	This video, is a good video for all ages. It is sortive a cartoon with singing, Order it, you will not be dissapointed
POSITIVE	I think Jim Marrs, though very long-winded, has written a very well thoughtout book. Anyone who makes it through this book will come away with the same conclusion; there is NO WAY in the world Oswald acted alone, and the Warren Commission was a joke from its inception. The facts are clear...the american public has been led astray for over 35 years.
NEGATIVE	I read the reviews and bought it anyway. I wanted a little extra full-spectrum portable light at work, and it does provide that, but don't touch it or it falls apart. I am keeping it to clip on my computer screen at work but don't recommemd it, especially to someone who wants to clip it to a book!
POSITIVE	sore/cracked nipples are very common on breastfeeding moms especially first time moms who doesn't have any clue about latching.1 oz might seems very less but it is good enough. Latching will get way better after the first 3-4 weeks and you might not need to use it afterwards. So there is no need to get a 5oz bottle. Motherlove Herbal Nipple Cream helped me a lot with soreness. Also note that this cream is better used for prevention than cure. So apply it before feeding itself. Also remember to air dry.
NEGATIVE	I was disappointed with this one. The Big Book of... series tends to be hit-and-miss. This one's a miss. There seems to be a shortage of actual games, and a lot more ideas for how to get a good healthy discussion about Topic X. If that's all you need, this may be a good one. I was looking for actual games and activities...found a lot of them in Miller's Quick Teambuilding Activites for Busy Managers. But all the activities in that book are short, so if you need anything to last more than 15-20 minutes, try Ukens' All Together Now--some of them are longer (for retreats and other long meetings).
NEGATIVE	This book starts off well enough, with the author buying a house that has some oddities about it. But then, the book fails to gel, and becomes progressively disjointed. After several chapters of recounted dreams presented as occurances, I gave up and didn't finish it.My impression is that the author really wanted to write a book, and she was also into ghosts, so she decided to start with a true life ghost story. The only problem: her material is thin. She starts off well enough, moving into a house with some creepy atmosphere. But what follows is mostly dreams, anecdotes about noisy pipes and other settling noises and accounts of people who 'felt something'. I never became convinced that the house was really haunted, or just that she really wanted it to be haunted.Borrow this, if you have a lot of patience for amateur writing and efforts, and want to explore every possible ghost story. It's too insubstantial an effort for me to recommend as a purchase.
POSITIVE	All of the Le Carre novels involve the theme of betrayal and exploitation in some subtle manner. This is one where the main character, as actress, has to betray and exploit herself. She - and by implication, we as readers - never know what is authentic and what is artifice in her. Le Carre demolishes the distinction. For this very quality she is taken on by the Israeli secret service, who need to construct an elaborate but plausible facade. Like all Le Carre's other novels there's an ambivalence about what is right and wrong. The characters are complex, ofttimes confusing in their motives and unsure of the efficacy and rightness of what they're doing. What makes this book unusually troubling is Le Carre's exposure of the fakeness and schism in the soul of western man.Is there anything bona fide and clear about us? Is life for us just theatre?
POSITIVE	In addition to providing up-to-date information about dating on his new radio show, R. Don Steele provides more than the basics to dating women in this book. This book covers skills beyond those found in his first book. He goes into more depth about meeting and dating women. He also describes how to identify women with emotional problems and how to use the phone effectively when talking with women.
NEGATIVE	I have an all region DVD player and these will not play. Don't waste your money.
POSITIVE	"If you regularly find yourself saying ""Yes"" to others when you really want to be saying ""No, no, no!"" The Book of No may be just what you need. The theme at the heart of this book is the eye-opening truth of ""When you say yes continually to others, you say no to yourself.""After shedding some light on why it can be so easy to fall into the yes-trap, Susan helps light the way to the path of saying no. In addition to providing 250 instructive and entertaining just-say-no scenarios, Susan's book is packed with hard-hitting insights including: ""Each time you agree when you don't want to, you give up a piece of yourself"" and ""No is the cornerstone of self-respect and your gateway to being able to concentrate on what makes you feel better and more in command of your life.""The Book of No is certainly a read worth saying yes to!"
NEGATIVE	Being one of those who received this book only to be completely disappointed when the pages fell out, I turned to the Amazon reviews to see if others were disappointed as well. Having read the reviews, I am completley confused. I think these are two different books! My book is 112 pages, has no bibliography, no editor's notes, nothing outside of the letters themselves. I can't even find an editor's name! It is published by Pavilion Press, Philadelphia in 2003.As I read the reviews of people who love the book, they describe a completely different book.What gives?
POSITIVE	Great product. We would buy it again and again. We have been very pleased with these targets. They are very small, but they work just fine!
NEGATIVE	Amazing how a fellow who never held a paint brush in his hand can review artists.He looks down on Wyeth, but I dare him to paint one moment of truth. Build up a lifetime of painting and drawing before you break people down into your little boxes. You have no idea what it is to spend ones life, studying, painting, trying to capture a play in light, a form, a gesture, a feeling within a soul. You are the angry little boy that wish he could.
POSITIVE	man o man kaki king is incredible she plays a very unique style that no composer or musician can describe its not conformed in any way shape or form,yet still very original and daring she doest just make music out of her guitar she expresses life and her experience and creates a true to life beautifully compelling sound.That said she inherself is an accomplishment,keep inspiring!!!!
NEGATIVE	Story was long and confusing. Gilbert Grape played by Johnny Depp was moody and depressing. He seemed to be quite confused and misguided and one had to assume what he was thinking most of the time. Leonardo DiCapprio's acting was the saving grace for this movie. He had evidently studied his role of the handicapped brother and was very realistic. Would not recommend this unless you have nothing else to do on a rainy afternoon.
NEGATIVE	Stay away from this product, it has a strange substance, not enjoyable at all, and the worst is the fragrance, quite nauseating, gave me a headache. I've tried a number of facial moisturizers and this got to be the worst !
POSITIVE	Fox provides refreshing advice that everyone should keep in mind. Althought the points aren't really specific to being a CEO, they're tidbits of good advice on the most important adventure of all, Life. A book that's not only worth the money, but definitely worth the time.
NEGATIVE	After using this mouse very lightly and gently for 2 months, the left mouse button stopped working about half of the time. I called Microsoft Customer Support this morning and they said that could not help me. So, now I'm stuck with a $40 mouse that doesn't work.Don't get me wrong, this is the most comfortable mouse I've ever used. But, when all is said and done, it cost me about $0.75 per day of use, which is much too expensive for any mouse.
POSITIVE	The music from this album, shows what a talented artist Richard Carr is. His music finds a way into your heart and carries you off on a romantic and sweet journey of the mind. Each song on this album is deeply moving and seems to be able to affect the senses. My favorite piece off this album is Rocky Mountain Peace. With his amazing ability, Richard Carr managed to capture and put to music, the serene feeling of being in the Rocky Mountains. I cant wait for his next release
NEGATIVE	This is not the usual quality that Playhut stands for. The tent is held up by one plastic-corded pole that won't keep the tent upright. My daughter gets trapped in it as it collapses. The slumber bag is pretty, but the tent/tunnel is useless.
POSITIVE	My daughter's kindergarten teacher read this to the kids and the parents the first day of school for orientation. I can tell you not a dry eye with the bunch of us parents! It was so touching that evening as well when my daughter asked me to kiss her hand so she could take it to school with her the first day. This will be an heirloom book for my other child as well as my grandchildren
NEGATIVE	I received this in the mail today, unfortunately it's already back in the box for return. I bought it to help my baby sleep and block out the noises in the house from her room. I plugged it in and tried to set it down and it immediately turned off. I tried again and touched the AC adapter cord and it cut off again. When I was able to get it to stay on for longer than a few seconds, the loudest volume setting was way too low.
NEGATIVE	As a long time Cussler fan I was deeply disappointed. Although Mr. Cussler's stories are quite often true escapism at its finest, the plot behind the plot was too inconceivable and ridiculous.The book is also quite dated, in that it was written during the cold war. To read today of the KGB plots and our paranoia is uncomfortable and boring.I am sure this book would have been much more enjoyable if read 20+ years ago.
NEGATIVE	To start, this printer eats ink like a fat kid at the buffet. I saw a cheap HP Photosmart D5160, and considering that my previous Photosmart 7660 lasted me three years, I jumped on it. It was a false economy in terms of both the massive ink consumption and subpar quality. The blacks simply don't look right out of the standard cartridge- kind of a blueish middle gray, even when excluding the color cartridge. This isn't something you'll only see when printing B&W; photos- text looks kind of nasty too. Of course, HP would prefer that I purchase the Photo Black cartridge, which I'm sure would help. However, it's ridiculous that I have to buy the Photo Black cartridge to get decent-looking text and graphics.I'm about ready to punt this printer off the nearest bridge.
POSITIVE	I have trusted the Lasko name in the past. And am glad I did again.not toonlow. Not too high. Its structure is safe for my cat.Can't say that it is noisy. I just wish that it was a little quieter.Otherwise-price included-I would call it perfect.
POSITIVE	"""Strength and Honor: The Life of Dolly Madison"" by Richard (...) Cote is excellent reading and a work of art. Mr. Cote has once again shown that he is one of the best writers of our era. His work continues to excel and there is no limit to his artistic ability to dazzel the reader with his painting of history with a flair that only his author's brush can make. This is another masterpiece that hangs well beside ""Mary's World"" and ""Theodosia Burr Alston"""
POSITIVE	"I guess I'm just a fan of novelty hits. I mean, I enjoy ""The Eggplant that ate Chicago!"" So, two of Croce's hits I always hear on the old folks radio are on this CD: ""You don't mess around with Jim"" and ""Bad, bad Leroy Brown"" are here for our enjoyment. There's also that time in a bottle thing that is okay once in a while. And, Croce fans will enjoy the other stuff, but the two novelties would be great candidates to download, from Amazon of course, to your personal music container."
POSITIVE	Considering Nessus is one of the best free network monitoring tools on the market, this is a perfect book to get to start working with Network Systems Auditing. For people that have a decent working knowledge with multi-platforms and Networking, this book is a good way to get your feet wet with to start preparing for your CISA Cert.
POSITIVE	Think..a happy Tori Amos. Think..Fiona Apple at her proper weight level.This is great music. And Regina Spektor should be a star. I can't wait to see what's next.
POSITIVE	"Modern county music has lost its sense of melody along with its sense of traditional themes (Try singing along with Big & Rich & some of the every current stars). This is one of the reasons that Joni Harms is special - her songs actually have a melody & deal with the themes usually associated with country music. The other reasons are that they are sung by a lady who has a great voice & alot of enthusiasm, & the songs are just good music - they are not over-produced & the musicians are playing traditional country music instruments; no synthesizers or wailing elctric guitars. This CD is great & so is the more recent ""Let's Put The Western Back in Coutry Music"".You should buy these CD's because you will enjoy them and also to send a message to the ""suits"" in Nashville that we want our country music back."
POSITIVE	I have all of her books and I reread her books all the time . I love her story lines.I recommend her books to all my friends.
NEGATIVE	The picture of this item seems to depict a soft and supple quilted cotton throw/blanket. What I received, although very attractive, was a thick and stiff quilt. Not something baby can snuggle up in for sure! I'm hoping after about a dozen washings with fabric softener that this thing will loosen up. I'm not too optimistic...
POSITIVE	In this novel, Marisa de los Santos breathes life into the abstract concept of love. Initially, Cornelia falls for all the cliched traps of love stories--handsome leading men, feet being swept off the floor, life-altering kisses. She's like so many of us, waiting and hoping for our chance at meeting our soulmate.What I love about this book is Cornelia's transformation. She realizes that true love is attainable, and it is real. It is, at times, ugly and complicated. Love is hard; it cuts one to the soul. Love is romantic and familial and maternal. One's soulmate could be an old friend or a young child.The ending is not a happy ending, but it is the only possible ending. I wanted to shake Cornelia, to tell her to change her mind, to be selfish. But her decision was the right one. She has been changed--in an earth-shattering way--and has found a purpose in life. I can't wait to read BELONG TO ME, and perhaps I will find more closure.
NEGATIVE	This book reads like something a person would write in anger, then destroy. Too bad it got published. I can't imagine betraying my own father like this. The writing is not that good, and at times I was embarrased to be reading it. You won't learn anything about Salinger that you would want to know. And we must remember that this is only one person's side of the story. Maybe if Salinger had kept publishing, we wouldn't be so desperate for some kind of contact with him, and then this sad memoir wouldn't have gotten printed.
NEGATIVE	Worked well for 2 years then all the sudden motor quit working. Only used lightly (maybe once every two weeks).Two design flaws:1) the clear cap at the top doesn't seal well and liquid will leak out the top when you first blend something and it splashes at the top.2) The plastic teeth that connect the blade with the motor assemble are brittle and eventually break. After 2 years, 3 of the six were broken off.At least the blender is relatively inexpensive.
NEGATIVE	If you're looking for a sexy scent that is fun -- LOOK ELSEWHERE! This stuff smells like bottled fart. The seller was fantastic, but the product isn't worth it. I can't even rate it on the star scale because a 1 is too good for it.
NEGATIVE	"I have had this phone for two months and have experienced too problems with it.It does not hold a charge.I get the ""OUT OF SERVICE"" message too often.Horrible echoStatic noiseRedial only holds one numberI will seriously advice anyone to reconsider this purchase."
NEGATIVE	I grew up with a Toastmaster waffle iron of this size (It's still in my Mom's cabinet). My wife and I were given a Toastmaster waffle iron as a wedding gift 30+ years ago and it still works, but the cord is frayed and the waffles are now tending to stick to the plates. So it was decided now is the time to up grade, the Black and Decker being the closest look-a-like. When it arrived I was very disappointed. Wattage is only 900W. The old Toastmaster had 1500W for this size. There are 2-square units ou there that have 900W. Plus the metal just seemed thin and flimsy. The clips holding the plates in seemed very light and bendable. So we sent it back! Would I recommend it to a friend? Absolutely not. I'm still looking for a quality replacement for the old Toastmaster.
NEGATIVE	I had never tried making tortillas before and carefully read the other reviews before I bought this item. I have been cooking most of my 56 years and have never had anything turn out as badly as the tortillas I tried to make with the device. No matter how hard I tried, or how many times I pressed the dough (must have been at least 40 or 50 times of turning, pressing, etc.) I could not get them thin enough to slightly resemble the tortillas from the store; they mainly looked like pancakes, they were so thick. Have no idea if the electic part would work, as I never tried it (used a griddle as recommended in another review). Maybe one person managed to figure out how to use it, but I would not recommend it to anyone!
NEGATIVE	My first one would not work below a heart rate of 95, so I exchanged it. The replacement did the same thing, no readings at all until you get up to the 90's. Once there, it seems to work well in the higher numbers to 145 [my own max--I'm old]. Coming back down, it does the same thing, responds well and works until HR drops below 90, then very erratic and finally stops working. It was so cheap I will keep it because it does work on higher HR, but I would not recommend it.
NEGATIVE	I checked it out thinking it would be an interesting perspective on some 70s cults, but when I started reading I realized it was on the intellectual level of the booklets Latter Day Saints pass out, with some historical background on other cults.I finally grew tired of the author's preachiness and arrogance, and the rampant hypocrisy in all of his arguments.Probably if you are already a member of a socially acceptable fundamentalist christian cult, you might find this book more interesting.
POSITIVE	My husband needs great help when it comes to organization, and I saw this read the reviews and thought what a great idea. He loves it, already had a bucket (he has lots of them). He said the pockets are great sized and he can fit his drill and loves the middle part for big items. Whenever he is doing handywork he just grabs his bucket and has everything he needs right there. Now I can find tools when I need them also. I like it so much got me one for my garden tools.
POSITIVE	As usual, I get what I expect from Amazon.com! Cheap, fast, easy, and a new item for my DVD collection!
NEGATIVE	Kind of hard, rock and blues and country, these guys would be a huge live sensation in this town. I can't say they don't play or sing well, nor are their songs poorly written. But it's just not my cup of tea - for me, this one's a total bust.
NEGATIVE	It's a pleasant-enough book to get from the library and look at for 15 minutes, but I don't think it's worth the price to buy. These are one-of-a-kind quilts from the covers of Quilter's Newsletter Magazine and I can't imagine anyone wanting to replicate these patterns.
POSITIVE	I LOVED this jumper. Our floorplan is very open, so we don't have doorways in which to hang a jumper. Also, that idea has always made me very antsy, so the idea of a free-standing jumper made me feel much safer. I love the 5 height adjustments, the washable pad and removable front toys. I love that almost every piece can be easily washed and the others just take a little more time. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the amount of space it takes up. It is very wide and even when folded, requires quite a bit of space. It does make some noise when your baby jumps, but nothing unbearable. All in all, I loved this product and so did both of our boys!
POSITIVE	This zombie survival guide really brings scientific evedince into the equation. Whether or not the evedince is true is up to you. All i can say is that if zombies were real this is what the book that would tell you exactly what they would be and how to survive it. Also it keeps religion almost completly out of it along with magic and voodo. It is worth the full buy and personaly i think it should be worth double the current price. Good job Max Brooks.
NEGATIVE	It looks great and doesn't work well. There is no way of tensioning the two halves together so after two cups of tea I had piles of floating leaves in the cup. I tried every way of bending it together but nothing worked. It's now in the trash where it belongs.
NEGATIVE	After applied this Eye Silk, I feel like two blocks of wax under my eyes. If I touch it, it will peel off just like wax. And even worse, it looks like scurf of my skin.
NEGATIVE	Vista should get no stars. We are all beta testers for Mad Doctor FrankenGates. I hope he burns inhell for all the trouble he has caused with this junk known as Vista. Microjunk is so worried about themselves and their profits, they have forgotten how to take care of their customers. Don't waste your money on any more micro-junk, buy a Mac like I did. You will not be disappointed.Microsoft vista......What a joke!
POSITIVE	There will probably never be another production with this much magic involved. The time was the Berlin Wall coming down, the place was Berlin. The crowd numbered in the tens of thousands. Luck and God was on their side to pull this off in so little time. AMAZING!!! There could not have been a better celebration of such a historical event in time.
POSITIVE	This CD from the Regimental Band of the Coldstream Guards is good quality in terms of sound, in range of items, and in the quality of the playing. The band is well conducted, the items are played at proper tempo, and they cover key themes across the British Isles in terms of national tunes.
POSITIVE	Lightbulb, which was a replacement, came on time and fit the bill, useful... Timely service, worked fine. Lovely lightbulb, no laziness, lights fine.
POSITIVE	I am very happy with this buy. My son nestles comfortably into the wide seat and enjoys the swinging motion. He is over 12 lbs and the swinging motion is just as strong as the big swing we have for him at home. He loves to look at the mirror on the toy bar and bat the toys that hang on the side. This swing folds and unfolds easily with one hand which is important for a portable baby toy. It is quite sturdy for a travel product and has great nonslip rubber pieces on the bottom. I could do without the music, but otherwise it was a great buy for us.
NEGATIVE	This book just plain out bored me. What was the ghostwriter thinking when he wrote this? It made me wonder whether he was drugged out on narcotics or something. These books just keep getting worse and worse.
POSITIVE	"I will start by saying that this book is incredibly dense, as most reviewers have mentioned. However, if you are willing to not understand every last historical and occult reference, this book is absolutely fascinating. I fell completely into Eco's trap. I tried to follow his descriptions of the occult, puzzling out what it could all mean. I was intrigued by hints at ""the Plan"" and attempted to figure out just what this plan could be. Upon reaching the end of the novel, I felt like I had been duped, but brilliantly so. There is no plan, it is all fiction, yet I, just like characters such as Aglie and Bramanti, had fallen into the trap of believing. Eco truly got the last laugh."
NEGATIVE	rent it see how you like it, i would say that its not worth the money. The game has nice graphics but thats about it. The gameplay is simple but the camera is always off slightly making Harry hard to control, it is next to nothing like the book, don't expect it to be like the book or the movie the game is completley different. it's also far to easy, the game tells you exactly what to do. I would recommend the game for younger gamers 6-13.
POSITIVE	"I remember getting this game back in 1999 for Christmas. I still have it and play it every now and then on my old N64. Nowadays, when I play it, I'm thinking, ""WTF?"", but back about 7 years ago, I thought it was the sh-t. I'm sad that it's not being made anymore, because it was a great game. Maybe they should make a sequel!"
POSITIVE	"What a delight! Since leaving the Buffalo area last year I've been getting my Canada fixes vicariously, and this book did the trick nicely this month. Familiar, yet alien, alien, yet familiar. The idea of the ""Canada House"" is brilliant (and a brilliant piece of environmental art, to boot). Pick this one up if for no other reason than it's a cool coffeetable book that will confuse your less travelled friends. . ."
NEGATIVE	I'm online now to buy my third one of these collars (fourth if you count the one given by a friend). The upside: the collar really works for my dog. I tried all sorts of other training methods (other than shocks) that didn't work. This collar stops him at one bark, if that. The downside: the collars just don't last, not even a year. If Premier would put a warranty on this item, they would find that they needed to invest a little in the quality of the product. They simply stop spraying after a while, even with a brand new battery and a refill. Normally I would not continue to buy an item with such low quality, but I'm addicted to a nice quiet house now, so I keep coming back. Expect about a 9-month product life, and that's if you NEVER forget and leave the unit on overnight!
NEGATIVE	Mr Taberham should remove his Iancu Dumitrescue head from his electro-acoustic backside and listen to the lyric's of Bambi's music. By encouraging the lyrics to pop songs such as `Because we Want to' we are creating a generation of retro-rebellion reminiscint of the revoloutionary rantings of popular banjo demon Neil Smith. Furthermore, Billie's lyrical inspiration derives from the early satanic scriptural writings of the demonic xylophone artist Paul Taberham, do ya get ma drift? Hey, whatever happened to those chocholate `Drift' bars, where did they go? No doubt the work of Billie...
NEGATIVE	1. The directions are detailed, but confusing, Even though the directions contain pictures, you would do well to look up pictures and descriptions on the web of different types of scissors.2. Still looking for replacement stones. Mine are already grooved after ten pairs of scissors.3. Since I managed to run several pairs of scissors due to not understanding parts of the directions, I will be opting for the Chef's Choice 500 model to eliminate some of the guesswork
NEGATIVE	I liked this machine at first but after a couple of months it started leaking water on the counter. Then the steamer/frother on the expresso sode stopped working. Thex expresso maker wasn't hot enough either. After less than a year the whole thing completely burned out and left a dime-sized burn mark on my counter. Going back to using the stovetop percolator and the expresso maker. They have never let me down!
POSITIVE	This I like, because I hate needles but these are really thin and get's the job done. Will always be using these for sure.
NEGATIVE	I am a mormon and know that the mormon church is true and that god loves all of us Amen
POSITIVE	If you are looking for an original, creative, and hilarious Christmas special for the entire family to watch...check this one out. Fran Drescher is hilarious and the rest of The Nanny cast lends their voices in this clever and well written take on the holidays. A great gift idea for all!!
NEGATIVE	Although it's better after four listens than it was after one, this one's going to need more time to grow on me. Love the voice, but I'm disappointed by the mostly weak songs. Two hummable tunes in a full-length album isn't much.
NEGATIVE	"August 16, 2012 I ordered the HP88XL Magenta and Cyan. I had to replace the Magenta and Cyan but now I have a problem with the printer and cannot print because it gives me the following message: ""Cyan is outdated cartridge"" Could you please tell me what to do?"
NEGATIVE	"Will someone please tell the King that he has no clothes on? Will someone please stop stocking Physics departments with books that are simply a flag for how clever we all are. ""Look at this book chaps...""as we flaunt the open text, ""bloody tough to understand, eh?!""Giancoli is accurate and detailed. Giancoli is a fantastic text to dip into (for the most) able student. In my experience of delivering the subject within the English National Curriculum it is hopeless for the 'average' Physics student. Giancoli is black and white in a colourful world. Has anyone that has ordered this book ever seen a Tom Duncan? Have you looked at the Longman series? Streuth!Why do 'we' make it so difficult for people to access our subject?"
POSITIVE	I had never seen this movie before but love animals and wanted to add it to my collection. The movie was great! Have your tissues ready!
POSITIVE	I read this cover to cover and enjoyed every delicious word! YUM. I love to cook this way anyway, and having just returned from the Mediterranean, I had a great appreciation for the menus and foods (which I just recently ate - double yum). I'm excited to have this in my inventory of cookbooks.
POSITIVE	I read this book five years ago and it's still on my mind as one of the best books I've ever read. Jennifer Belle's writing style and wit grabbed me and wouldn't let me go. If you're a little bit twisted and love to laugh don't miss this book. I keep watching for her to write another book. I'll be first in line. Jennifer Belle writes like no other.
POSITIVE	My 4 year old loves all of these Scooby Doo Picture Clue books. I like them too since I grew up with Scooby Doo it makes me feel like we have something in common other than DNA.
NEGATIVE	I wish, I could have read the Karen's review before I placed my order. I got an intimation after a week that the product is not available.Why are they listing the product if it is not available for delivery ?!I wish I would have given a negative star rating instead of a rating of one star.
POSITIVE	ASIN:B000SBRKDQ StreetPilot c550 Mobile GPS Receiver]]This order for the Power Adapter was to replace the one I orginally got with my C550. The part which holds the fuse came apart and I thought I lost a piece. Now I have 2, which is good because if I happen to be traveling I have a back-up in case one becomes broken. I really love my Garmin C550 and it has been helpful in finding places in my home town as well as other places I've been traveling. What a great invention!!!
NEGATIVE	The songs on this album bare no resemblance to the versions played in concert. And the songs are all below average besides. The fans of 80's and 90's Dead may like this album but it lacks passion. This is the reason the dead took over 5 years to make another album. The version of Feel Like a Stranger has no jamin like it did later on. Songs like Alabama Getaway, Lost Sailor, and Easy to Love You, just are plain boring. The only bright spot here is Althea though played much better live. If you wanted to introduce someone to the Dead do not show up with this CD, It is a loser all the way
NEGATIVE	"My search criteria does mention audio book or audible.com and yet I am being given ""recommendation"" for an Audible.com product.I want to READ Heinlein, not listen to him. How do I block all offerings of audio books and mention of Audible.com."
POSITIVE	This is a very good book but it is a little dated. We are helping to protect seniors from scams with presentations and this is an excellent book for them. It is not written with a lot of legal terms and it has basic information how to protect seniors from financial exploitation. Get this book for your parents. The will find it very helpful. The book has a great list of places to contact for help. This can be very confusing to seniors.
POSITIVE	The fourth episode of this third season, DOUBLE EXPOSURE, was broadcasted on Dec. 16th, 1973. It's also possible to watch this episode in the DVD standard by purchasingColumbo - The Complete Third Season. AfterColumbo Collector's Edition: Dagger Of The MindandColumbo Collector's Edition: Requiem For A Falling Star, this is the third Columbo episode directed by famous director Richard Quine. It's also, afterColumbo Collector's Edition: Death Lends A Handand THE MOST CRUCIAL GAME, the third time Robert Culp impersonates the criminal in the serie.In this episode, Lt. Columbo must confound Dr. Bart Keppel who, during the projection of a commercial short film, murdered Vic Norris. Columbo, in front of an adversary specialized in the study of consumer habits, will have to use the same arms than Keppel to expose him.A VHS to keep in your library.
POSITIVE	"I've been eating/cooking soul food for almost my whole life and I thought i've tasted everything but there is an actual ""Soul Food Seasoning out now called Annabelle's Soul Food Seasoning... It gives that down-home southern cooking taste that you just hope you get close to when you cook soul food. So if you buy this book buy Annabelle's seasoning too it's also sold on Amazon--- it will take EVERYTHING to the next level... From one soul food cook to another... Thats a promiseGod Bless"
NEGATIVE	We ended up selling it. It wasn't what we were looking for - we needed something more entertainly/interactively written. It's for an older student.
POSITIVE	This is a classic comedy. I have only seen several movies worth owning. This is definitely one. Jack Nicholson is an amazing mixture of brilliance, an impossible personality, vulnerable, honest, and certifiably insane.Nicholson is supported with actors that don't fade to the background and who challenge him. They actually slip a robust story in on you while you laugh.This is seriously one of the best movies you could buy. Great for trips, family nights, I watched it the other day just for a laugh.
POSITIVE	Mounting this thing in the truck bed was so easy, then pulling it back out was even easier. Mounting the bike to the rack also a snap. The only thing I find that might be an issue is the clamp up of the bike mount on the rack. It either loosened itself or the clamp spread apart. How I noticed this is the bike began to wobble as I was going down the road. The wobble stopped as I re-tightened the clamp. I am still monitoring it I am overall satisfied with the rack.
POSITIVE	Paulo Freire is one of the unsung heros in the field of education. Here he is again, writing such terse sentences that they have to be re-read several times to absorb all their nutrients. Just like his brilliant Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Education for Critical Consciousness is an antidote to the current U.S. crisis of ignorance and consumer-insanity.
NEGATIVE	I have a commercial account with multiple phones, V365s and RAZR V3s. After working through multiple work arounds and downloading additional phone specific files, the only piece of this software that came close to working was the backup feature and after all the trouble I was not confident enough in the product to wipe a phone and try to restore the phone book. I subsequently learned that there are known issues with different versions and service pack levels of W2K as well as XP. I finally un-installed the software and threw it away. I purchased what was advertised as a retail package but what I got was a CD and two cables stuffed in a bubble wrap envelope (which is what I expected for the price but it should have been described correctly). It did arrive on time and undamaged. I finally signed up for the back up service from my provider for $1.99/mo. which works fine. Don't waste your money on this product.
POSITIVE	We wanted a grill cover that was going to hold up. Very happy with this purchase. The quality is much better than the plastic ones you buy at lowes and I don't see this one tearing up easily. Worth the few extra bucks to have something that is going to last.
NEGATIVE	the item took a month to arrive and i did not recieve a response when i enquired about why it was taking so long
NEGATIVE	I owned Salton yogurt makers for over 30 years, and when the last one died, I found out Salton no longer makes them. So, I purchased this model. First off, the description says the jars hold 6 ounces of yogurt. No way! If you follow the recipe and heat 1 quart of milk, and add the 1/2 cup of live culture yogurt, you are left with almost 3/4 cup that won't fit in the jars! The tiny jars are more like baby food jars, and not only do they not hold 6 ounces, the tiny opening and lip on the inside make them hard to eat out of and clean. As a side note, in the 30 years I have been making yogurt I have never added any more than 2 heaping tablespoons of yogurt and always got perfect results.
NEGATIVE	As I began the book I felt confident that I was in for a treat. In fact the first half had all the makings of a great thriller. Some where along the way the author got lost in the words. He developed needless characters, absurd scenarios and seemed to be more intent on filling pages with words then in telling a good tale. The climactic ending was completely unbelievable. By the end I was forcing myself to turn pages so I could move on to a new book.
NEGATIVE	Reminiscent of essays written by bored school children, The Planets by Sobel is lacking in enthusiasm and excitement for its subject matter. The boring regurgitation of fact bogs down what might otherwise be an novel approach to astronomy integrating myth and science. I highly recommend this book to those who have trouble sleeping at night, otherwise find an author who brings the wonders of the planets to life.
POSITIVE	Hoberman's collection of 13 essays investigates the work of 6 female authors (Mitchison, Butts, Riding, Bentley, Bryher, and Renault) who wrote at the end of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century in England. Chapters 1, 2, 8, and 13 are very general as they look at the nature of education and gender roles in England during the lifetimes of these six authors. At times her analysis of how the real lives of authors are reflected in their work seems stretched to the limit -- but this could be claimed in most literary analysis. As a writer, I can say that yes, our lives affect our work, but how it affects it can only be truly understood by talking to the author herself and there is no evidence that Hoberman has done this. She uncovers a good number of books which I did not know exist and so I'm off to find a few of them.
NEGATIVE	This is the worst economics book i have ever come across in my 4 years as a student. The book is not only colorless and boring, but it does not seem to ge the main points across. Worse yet, the homework questions sometimes draw on information not explained in the text. Examples are very few, and the confusion is much. I would advise economic teachers to look elsewhere for a text.
POSITIVE	Very well done! Anyone interested in the US healthcare system should watch Sick Around the World!
POSITIVE	This is a great CD and awesome band, this is just what I wanted. thank you I will enjoy this.
POSITIVE	This book is pretty good, although it would most likely appeal to the more grown-up crowd and I am sure that most young people would like it too.The book is completely narrarated by the author. It is composed of little stories of things that have happened to him in his life.I would recommend it to everyone.
POSITIVE	At first this was hard to use we just could not figure it out but once we got it to work right I loved how easy it was
NEGATIVE	"I want to start by saying that i have loved Joan Wolf books until the last 3. it seems Ms wolf is in a bit of writer block.This last book "" High Meadow"" is really a rehash of a few past books. The main caracters are all from past books and in general lack tridimensionality. I absolutely love Ms. Wolf Female Caracters, they are spunky, independant etc. here Kate is really nothing, Molly the same as for the Main male caracter we already met him in another short novel of Ms. Wolf about a rich Latin American Base Ball Player. I must say all the paragraphs about base ball are chinese to me. So on the whole I do not recommand this book.I hope we will get to reall business soon."
POSITIVE	Dancehall Reggae, Soca, and Reggaeton all mixed together one one CD? This compilation is a dream come true. Miami radio station Power 96's Eddie Mix brings the sexy flavor of Miami to wherever you are. If there is a soundtrack to the vibe of Miami this is it! You should probably buy 2 of these because one of your will friends will definitely steal it.
NEGATIVE	"I'm reading this book because my book club choose it. It's mostly narrartive. There are no scenes of action and very little dialogue. Then in part two the author switches to using the present tense which is an irrating tense to read in and certainly didn't make the story ""now"". I kept waiting for the real story to happen, but it doesn't. One thing, if writing this bad can be acclaimed, maybe my efforts have hope. I won't read another of her books."
NEGATIVE	boring to watch. i fell asleep 3 times when watching.this movie is so overrated!!you'll enjoy this if you are a poseur.
NEGATIVE	I would have liked it had the songs been from the singers that I remember performing them. I would not recommend this to anyone.
NEGATIVE	I bought my first Presto Power Pop many, many years ago. I loved it. Finally, after so many years of use the plastic bowl developed cracks on the bottom. So I ordered a new one. The concentrator base on this new one scorches holes in the paper concentrators after only 2 uses ( with the old popper I could reuse about 12 times.)
POSITIVE	I love this book. I did wish that it was in color, but the pictures and the notes are so voyeristic, I almost felt guilty for reading them! My favorite was the one where the mom and son were writing sitcky notes to each other about these scrambled eggs that had been in the refrigerater. And a grocery list that included 1 lb of Heroin....oddly interesting. I noticed that some of the names looked as if they had been cut out and re-written, so I wonder if they changed the names to protect people's privacy? Anyway, this book stays on my coffee table, along with PostSecret, and everyone who comes over is instantly addicted to it...so its been borrowed many times..a good, interesting read.
NEGATIVE	i thought she just came out with all the decade, anyway both albbum is not worth the effort and money.
POSITIVE	As a meditation teacher I found this text invaluable in understanding Zen Buddhism's meditation methods. It is important when teaching to have knowledge of different philosophies and teachings of meditation. Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind is a foundation text for this understanding. I have already recommended it to others. A great buy and, I should add great service from Amazon for us antipodeans. Cheers from Australia. Ed.
NEGATIVE	I remember watching this TV show some twenty-odd years ago and I thought it was pretty funny - sometimes. After doing some research on the net for recommended shows, I could see that this particular volume had two recommended episodes on it. Well, I can't say that there weren't some funny scenes, but, gee, a lot of the humor referred to movies and events that were current at the time of the episodes. Me, I remember them but still thought the gags pretty dull for the most part. I can only imagine how dull it might be for a younger person who would not know what was being referred to.Anyway, I cannot begin to imagine how these volumes got four stars. And at this price...? Unbelievable!
NEGATIVE	Terrible, terrible. Couldn't be worse, couldn't be worse.That being said, considering the length of the movie, it should receive negative stars! What was John Cusack thinking to appear in a turkey like this?
NEGATIVE	Not that I've bought a lot, but I must have a couple of dozen.The recording quality is poor, the Manhatten Transfer song was a cacaphony of noise, the duet had a giggle in it, at least one song cut out (no phase), singers voices were picked up by distant mics, etc.Big, big disappointment. If I could, I'd return it in a flash!
POSITIVE	Who wouldn't want to work with Wes Anderson? After his first two movies (Rushmore, Bottle Rockets) won great praise from critics and viewers alike this was one of the most anticipated flicks of last year. Take a heaping of Gene Hackmans dry delivery and sprinkle in a hip cast of the best of young hollywood has to offer then cover it all with Andersons painterly scenes. One of the best things about Anderson his his use of music and though Tenenbaums is a little heavy in the soundtrack department he still uses tunes as well as anybody in hollywood. For those who are surprised by this brand of film making try out some Hal Ashby (Harold and Maude).
NEGATIVE	The Crucible is an important play and a very good one. But the self-important approach this film gives Miller's script is devastating. Primarily, the acting is so overwrought as to be nearly laughable. Only Joan Allen and Daniel Day-Lewis, two of the best actors in the business, remain unsullied. The rest not only chew the scenery, they regurgitate it. Try it and see -- everyone else in here seemed to enjoy it.
POSITIVE	This Golden Book will bring back memories and give new ones for your little one. I think the story has a great message and needs to be taught to those little children as they are growing.
NEGATIVE	Apathy's presence on the mic is one you won't forget but this particular album is. More of a mixtape and Apathy compilation- there really isnt anything that sticks out. More lows than highs. I will give his new album 'Eastern Philosophy' a good listen but this album is a throw away. Makes me wonder...Is Apathy just a good cameo rapper?
NEGATIVE	I would have loved to have read the book. I ordered it via whispernet from Amazon, and tried to download it several times and I could not get it. Called customer service and they insist that there is no problem--however, I todate have recieved a full download of the book. Since it was only .99 cents it was really not worth the time and agravation. I will have to order a physical copy. Thanks Amazon....
POSITIVE	"The first single from this album is called ""Through the Rain"". It's like Old Mariah only even better. This is a beautiful ballad which has a similiar theme to ""Hero"" or ""Can't Take That Away"", but is even more incredible. If you liked ""old"" mariah, you will want this album. She does have rappers on it, but they aren't the main focus. It's such a beatiful song and I have heard soooooooooo many good things about this album ~ and not just from fans but from critics too! Go to her official site to listen to Through the Rain http://www.mariahcarey.com"
POSITIVE	This sturdy tool does the job quickly and effectively. What more could I ask? It's so simple and strong it will out last me hands down.
NEGATIVE	I have to be completely fair - others on the Amazon review postings warned about this - that GTR2 is NOT easy to play. I figured that it might be a little difficult, but not as difficult as it really is! As others have said, you cannot simply sit down and start flying around the track! Even the practice sessions are difficult to pass! Playing on the keyboard is virtually impossible (at least for me) - so I used a Logitech Rumblepad which did help, but still quite difficult. So I basically decided that I don't have the time to really learn how to play this game and will stick to easier ones!However, the graphics are indeed amazing. If you are really serious about racing games (I found out I am not very serious) then this game is probably for you!
NEGATIVE	This collection is so lame I don't know where to start. Where's Rock Candy, Trans Am, Plain Jane, This planet's on fire, I don't need love, Three lock box and so on.Oh yea. The fidelity sucks too. PASS!!!
POSITIVE	David Morrell's The Protector is a fast paced, action packed thrill ride. The book is solid from beginning to end and really immerses the reader in the life of the main character, Cavanaugh.Of specific note, Morrell's fight sequences are detailed enough to follow each movement, but not so much so that you feel like you can't let your imagination run with the story. Very visual.
POSITIVE	"Season 9 is a fine season.It does not blow dog.There is one of the most top rated Simpson episodes on this season the episode is ""Das Bus"". It is one of my favorite episodes.I recommend this season to you (whoever you are reading my review).And again this season does not blow dog."
POSITIVE	These cards are perched on the way to the front door.Whenever I have a few moments, I pause to pick a card.I enjoy the tidbit to take with me through my day.My personal set was given to me as a gift.I bought these as a gift for a friend.I will likely buy more.
NEGATIVE	"The McCulloh MC 1275 steamer was a big disappointment. It did not appear to be the same steamer advertised, & after the first initial use where it steamed nicely (no pressure just steam), I could not get this thing to steam again to save my life. All it did was squirt water and leak all over my floor. This does not appear very ""heavy duty"" either, as pretty much the entire machine is plastic. I thought I would give it a try though, but what a big mistake. I really expected something better than this for $130!I am going to look into getting one of the expensive ones that is around $500 in the hopes that it will perform better than this thing. I needed it to steam my sofa and loveseat, but this doesn't do much other than get it wet. My advice is to save your money."
POSITIVE	I am very pleased with this purchase. It is a nice weight for our climate and a good color to go with my wardrobe. Betty Downs
NEGATIVE	extremely cheap and poorly made set. the socket wrench is awful. the directional knob comes out when twister either direction, the ratcheting screwdriver is wobbly and not worth using, and the case does not hold the allen or bit sets tightly. very disappointed in this.
POSITIVE	This is a much better alternative to the suction cup mount that came with my GPS. Just place it on your dash and it stays in place perfectly.
NEGATIVE	The music is fine. The same can't be said for the CD. It played fine at first but within 2 weeks it started to lose cuts and be less and less reliable. The same player plays other CD's with no problems. This one is heading for the recycling bin.Don't waste your money.
NEGATIVE	These are very difficult to install. I had to get my big brute of a husband and he couldn't get it to turn. He had to go get channel locks to get the thing to turn. Had water running all over the floor. Very expensive, and they recommend you replace these every 6 months. Not necessary, the last one we had for over a year and my husband broke it up and he said it was clean inside. I would only replace once a year. Too expensive otherwise.
NEGATIVE	The Korean Limited Edition LP Miniature doesn't have 21 songs, it has only 13 songs and the CD is the same 2004 re-issue from Green Tree (GTR 629). At least is 300 Limited Edition and gatefolded with a lot of information about the band.
NEGATIVE	You would think that 800-thread-count sheets couldn't be bad, right? Well, we were a little disappointed. You can definitely see the very tightly woven fabric. I'm not sure what the problem is, but perhaps 800 threads/inch is too much. They almost remind me of having plastic sheets on the bed. I would have expected a very smooth satiny sheet, but they're a bit rough and loud. It's hard to slip out of bed and let your spouse sleep in without being noticed by the sound. Even after washing them several times, they're not much better. Perhaps a 400-thread-count sheet would better than these.
POSITIVE	"This toy is great for getting back at people from distances. It doesn't go 200 yards like the bag says, but it will go on average about 150 to 300 feet fully pulled back at a 60 degree angle. But I do enjoy playing with it with younger kids as they love how far the balloon goes and it makes the ""splat"" on impact.A few points I suggest you read over...- DO NOT make water balloons bigger than about the size of a tennis ball. When you pull the sling back with the balloon in it, it will explode.- Don't pull the sling back more than 6 feet from where your two helpers are at.- The grips are held in place by the tubing being bent inside the middle of the grip. Eventually they will pop out and the grip will be free moving. It doesn't affect the performance, but it is annoying.All in all, this isnt a bad sling. I'd recommend it. Hope this helped."
POSITIVE	The information provided in this book is excellent and insightful. Its presentation though makes it a little difficult to follow. I note that the original publication date was 1882 and maybe this is why it's not as easy as a more modern day version would be. I keep putting it down but have to keep picking it up again.
POSITIVE	After 3 weeks of use, we are very happy. First of all, the coffee is delicious. Second, when pouring water or coffee, there are no side spills or dripping. I love the style. The controls are easy to manage. The only thing that bugs me are the beeps. Five, when coffee is done. Two, when it shuts off. (My Cuisinart toater oven beeps too.)
NEGATIVE	"This is easily the worst movie I've ever seen with the second being ""The Chateau"" (seriously, it's worse than that). I love HP Lovecraft, but this is total and utter crap. I'd give this movie negative stars if I could as I can never get back the time spent on it. I think the creator of this movie should find another hobby other than creating crappy movies to torture people with."
POSITIVE	It makes possible some of the games that one plays on the Wii. It is easy to install and use and allows one to have more fun than a normal controller.
NEGATIVE	Just picked one up 11/1/2010 from Target for about the same price as Amazon. Opened box and found large receiver (mouse sized)with large cable attached. IMHO this is not wireless. Who would want the cable and receiver when you can get the small usb receiver smaller than a dime and easy to travel with.There is another post from 2008 so that tells me this thing is obsolete.Mine is going back.
NEGATIVE	I'm disappointed I can't rate it a zero. Andrew WK sucks hard. Don't even download this album for free.
NEGATIVE	"What a horrible experience. This seller sent me a totally different model, made by a different company. Then when I contacted him he said ""its the same thing"". Then When i demanded the correct model that i paid for he said, ""send it back at your expense and Ill charge you a re-stock fee of 10%"". What a horrible seller. Buyers all beware!"
POSITIVE	This scroll saw is a Bentley. By comparison, the other scroll saws on the market are Yugos, unless you want to fork over an outrageous sum of cash.
POSITIVE	jungle book is an enjoyable and funny film it is wonderful for children and i thought it was good as well.
NEGATIVE	I ordered this movie based on the excellent reviews from the previous three viewers, so I had high hopes for it when I put it in my DVD player. Unfortunately, as soon as the movie started, it became quite evident that it was very low budget. The acting was poor, there was no increase in tension at all, and the pointless conversation scenes were extremely long. I watched this movie for about one hour, before deciding to stop it. Mind you, I am very tolerant, and I try to find goodness in the majority of the movies I watch, but this one was intolerable.
NEGATIVE	This is a total fail. Go find the original recording. It is inexcusable to re-record 50% of such classic material. This is a bad replica of something great.
NEGATIVE	My daughter has all the Backyardigans dvds and they are great. They all come with 4 episodes on them, but for some reason this one comes with three and an episode of some other show. Guess they threw this together for the money and to get it out quick. But anyways she gets so mad when the forth episode comes on and it is not theBackyardigans. So I have to stop it and restart the dvd. All the others play through the 4 episodes and start over. If your just getting in to them get a different dvd.
POSITIVE	I've been searching for more books written by one of my favorite authors, Barbara O'Neal, and was surprised to find that she has written piles of books as Barbara Samuel, long before her most recent (and amazingly good) novels. So I ordered The Last Chance Ranch on my Kindle and loved it. I live in New Mexico and so frequently authors fail to hit the mark by over-romanticizing the location and its people, but Samuel (O'Neal) is obviously one of us. The characters are believable and their conflicts and resolutions aren't over-simplified. I found myself crying for these characters, both in sorrow and in joy. I consider myself a serious literature reader, but these books are a great read and very well done.
NEGATIVE	After purchasing this book and thinking I would be able to download the utilities and source code mentioned in the book... Also, it appears as if they are going out of business... their domain name is listed for sale at the top of their homepage.... Save your money and look elsewhere.
NEGATIVE	On *every* track. The same group of insipid female vocalists, miked down so that you have to strain to hear what they are singing in order to give Monk the lead spot. Give this one a miss.
NEGATIVE	**This review pertains to the audiobook version, not the print version.**The narrator (Mirron Willis) does splendid voice characterizations for all of the characters -American, British, Ugandan... All except for the Scot, Nicholas Garrigan. Willis makes the Scottish doctor sound mildly retarded or speech-impaired (or both?). Unfortunately, since the doctor's voice predominates throughout the book, I just couldn't bear listening to the whole thing. Too bad...
POSITIVE	Simply put, Buddy rich had no competition on the drums!He was the very best!The worlds greatest drummer, of all time!He was the very best, at what he did and played!He coluld play anything, and in any timing!His hand and foot speeds, were amazingly fast and always correct!There will never be another Buddy Rich.If you are able to purchase any of his dvd's, I would reccomend you do so.
POSITIVE	I bought this program as I have been drawing for years with Windows cad and Quick cad. They worked great on the older windows system but when we upgraded to 2000 xp we started having problems with lock ups. I took a chance (as Autodesk bought out those companies) to see if I could access my older .cad extension files. This program will load the old files and save them in a .cad format or the .skf which it normal saves files. The only caution is once you have loaded and saved in the Auto desk auto sketch, you can't go backwards. Your old software will not be able to read it. A good drawing package for a good price.
POSITIVE	Great price, free shipping. Fantastic for simmering soups and stews. Even used it for cooking a pork loin roast in the oven. Love it... Non-stick...
NEGATIVE	Paula's a great dancer, but when this video was choreographed she forgot that many of us work out on carpeting. This video incorporates many twisting and turning moves which are probably great on a wood or tile floor, but doing them on carpeting could injure your knees. Be careful!
NEGATIVE	The totally of the Larry Sanders show was an iconic masterpiece. Releasing it on DVD in several series would have made Sony a lot of money. But the 1st came late and the 2nd not at all. Instead these embarassing compilations. I just find it so annoying that they could be so shortsighted, crass and vandalistic. I plead with Sony to make good.
POSITIVE	Great tool for decorating. I have amazed so many many people. I can be so creative with all of my baking creations.
NEGATIVE	"The ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" series was a great invention for kids, and the first 14 or so were very interesting. However, simply put, R.A. Montgomery is not very good at writing them, unlike his colleague Edward Packard. Arbitrary, preachy, and sometimes practically incoherent, his books are only for rabid fans of the genre."
POSITIVE	I found this book to be a real page turner. The stories of the men involved made it feel as if you were there on D-Day. Definitely recommended for anyone who wants to learn about D-Day.
POSITIVE	"This is a great small bandsaw. Changing a blade is a breeze due to some smart engineering. The fence is very nice. Quiet. Adequate power. Base is well-made. Dust collection works tolerably well. Handles smaller tasks beautifully.The only weakness I've found is that it cannot resaw 6""-wide boards well. 4"", yes, but anything larger and the blade starts to wander. No amount of blade tensioning and/or adjusting can cure this for me. Perhaps others have mastered this task with this saw, but I have been defeated and picked up a big old Grizzly bandsaw just for resawing, which has worked out fine."
NEGATIVE	"I am not much of an Elliot Goldenthal fan, but I do enjoy some of his scores--Heat, Michael Collins, Interview w/a Vampire, Frida, and Final Fantasy. But this score is horrifically overrated! The alien movies have never had really strong scores, but I think the first one (Jerry Goldsmith's) is probably the strongest of the four. The dark, portentous alien music that I had expected was merely noise, with no coherent themes at all. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. But all is not a total loss; the final track, ""Adagio"" is actually quite good. If all of the score had the thematic material and emotion that is in ""Adagio"", this CD would easily be 4 or 5 stars. But, alas, the rest of the CD is noise. So you must decide whether four minutes of good orchestral music is worth however much you pay for this CD."
NEGATIVE	I was shocked when I read Rule's book. She apparently believed Kevin Meyers' story - hook, line and sinker! Anyone who knows Kevin (and I do) can tell you that he has misrepresented himself and Scurlock and the Scurlock family. I am appalled that Ann Rule did not take the time to substantiate any of his stories. I am dismayed at the way she has portrayed the Scurlock family. They are some of the most wonderful and caring people in this world. I think she owes them an apology! Also, the fact that she would present and claim that Kevin Meyer's story is fact, makes me wonder about her integrity. She has also gotten some of her crime facts wrong. I have personally read all of the official police reports and there is definitely differing evidence. This would be okay except she is presenting this book as fact. Anyone who reads this book should be aware of all of this.
POSITIVE	After reading Norman's The Bird Artist, I was amazed, yet doubtful he could repeat the brilliance. Well, in the Museum Guard, he does. It takes seemingly unconnected bits of history, art, and plot and blends them togethor to form one of the most memorable books I've read in a long time. His genius takes the trials of everday people and makes the reader interested, if not obsessed with the strange twists and turns this imaginative, original plot takes. Don't read this book if you seek a story about right and wrong, a bad guy and a good guy. Norman is too brilliant to write a story like that.
NEGATIVE	The pulley is plastic, not metal as pictured. I've added a photo to show the actual item that I received. The tensioner was made in Canada, according to the label on the box. The plastic pulley might be reliable, but I purchased this item based on the image showing a metal pulley.
POSITIVE	Having followed the teachings of SRF for more than 20 years. I found A Recipe for Bliss to be quite wonderful. Through the hOMe Foundations on-line lessons I have gone to deeper levels than I ever had before. For those interested in Kriya Yoga this book would be an invaluable resource.
NEGATIVE	Be aware that if you buy this, it is the basin only! You must find the pedestel and buy it separately. The image is misleading and makes this look like a good deal, but it is not. The product description does say that is it only the basin, but if you go by the image, you will not get what you were expecting.
NEGATIVE	"We ordered these chairs on March 5 and were called and told they would arrive on April 9. We were anxious for them to arrive until two weeks later we were called and ""encouraged"" to order our chairs from somewhere else. They could not get them even though they had them listed as in stock. Very disappointing!! At least they had the courtesy to call and let us know."
POSITIVE	"This book takes place in the projects of Harlem ,New york.Theres a 12 year old boy named Jamal that joins a gang ""Scorpions.""He joins the gang to help his mom to raise money to get his brother out of jail. his brother is in jail for killing someone for the Scorpions.Now Jamal has to make a choice to help his brother or help himselfand his family.I really enjoyed this book there was alot of obsticles in this book that Jamal and his family has to overcome. I recomend this book to alot of kids in Jr. high cause it really relates to teenagers like us . what are you waiting for go get te book ""Scorpions"""
NEGATIVE	After owning a seperate scanner and printer for awhile, I bought this combined unit to save some desk space. The price seemed right, and I didn't need the extra fancy features of the more expensive units, such as the LCD screen etc.To me, HP should have removed the memory card slots and put more engineering into the paper feed tray. My unit has worked flawlessly for about a year (or maybe less). I was very excited about the copy feature and scanner as it worked so well.But now as I sit, the paper tray will not feed paper. One sheet, multiple sheets, the tray will not grab the paper. I suspect to fix this unit, it will cost more than what I paid for it originally. The scanner still works wonderfully.If you search online, there are some other people that have experienced this same thing. I haven't even burned thru the original ink cartridges yet. Very disappointing.
NEGATIVE	I was looking for miso soup and just bought this bowl in supermarket for comparison with instant miso soup in packages. I don't like the bowl soup at all. I'd say it's not miso soup but plain noodle soup and noodle tastes not very pleasant. There is no miso taste and preparation takes too long. Instant miso in packages tastes great and there is no way I change my preference. BTW the best bet on instant miso packages I found is my local Trader Joe's Instant Miso Soup. The box contains 4 packets, each packet yield 2 cups soup, so it produces 8 cups soup for just about $5 with great miso taste. Even Amazon cannot beat that deal.
POSITIVE	We found out about this product from a friend. We tried it and it has definetly improved our dogs shedding. We will continue to buy this product.
POSITIVE	...it is fantastic! Gets your attention right from the start and doesn't let it go. You want (and need) to know what happens next! The descriptive thrills are great and written with style. Can't wait for book #2!
POSITIVE	"I adore this comp, probably becuse I love all Bubblegum. I couldn't agree more that they should have used Tommy Roe's Sweet Pea instead, though the lyrics in Jack and Jill are amusing. I was a kid and my babysitters used to listen to Bubblegum when I grew up in Manhattan Beach, CA and MAN this music brings it back! I am thrilled with the comp and the Bubblegum classics series. Now I don't have to cringe every time my 45s, which are all drawn on in crayon, skip! I was thrilled that they included The Sweet on this comp. If you like Little Willy (which is slightly ""harder"" than the rest) you might enjoy their LP Desolation Blvd which is more early glam, but still features great Teen lyrics and fabulous glam screams. Rock on!"
NEGATIVE	"I have to say that I didn't know Silk even had another album out. I just had a discussion with some friends the other day about Silk. I was wondering when they would come back. I have yet to buy ""Silktime"", but I will have to get it. I am a big fan of Silk and I own all their albums (except ""Silktime""). They may not be the Silk of the ""Freak Me"" days, but they are still one of, if not the best R&B group ever. P.S. I'm also a big After 7 fan. Does anyone know if and when they will be releasing new music???"
NEGATIVE	but I've read better.I was dissapointed. I was looking for something I could relate to. It felt more like a school book, something that you trudge along with, and in the end you've learned something but the trip there was long and kind of boring.
NEGATIVE	I bought this for my 7 year old and it rode for a couple times and after that it stopped working. I charged it for two days and it drove as fast as a infant can crawl and I am not able to return this product.
NEGATIVE	I love the show MobWives but was very disappointed after spending $41.00 on this disc set. I question the disc quality despite being sealed. Are these discs knock-offs??The first 2 discs were scratched upon opening--lost about 10 minutes of video on each disc due to skipping from the scratches!! Terrible quality!! And why does the volume on the discs go up and down? I have never purchased such poorly made DVDs!!Amazon should be responsible but lo and behold--when we log in they have no record of the purchase. Shame on VH1 for selling such crappily made discs through a questionable site like Amazon! So disappointed! It's enough to turn me off of the series altogether.Shame on VH1 and Amazon!!! Do not purchase!!!!!!
NEGATIVE	A waste of Time. Sonic produces the most Blinkware software I have ever used, By that I mean it just blinks at you, and does nothing, sometimes it crashes. Sonic get out of the Software Business please, you give a bad name to Software. Only buy this product if you have extra time to spend
POSITIVE	1. Forgive others completely everyday. 2. Forgive yourself completely everyday. 3. See yourself at your best. 4. Care for yourself Everyday.
POSITIVE	This cable is really good for the price! i have been using creepy cables that makes noises when plugged into the amp but this one keeps it quiet. Would like to purchase another one in the future. Buy it! it's worth it
NEGATIVE	Im in a apartment building behind another, with some large trees in the area I have 2 large windows at which the antenna is directed at, my apartment is approximately 24 miles from the broadcasting towers, I receive 2 HDTV Channel of approximately 25 available. In short unless you have a clear shot toward the tower you want reception from, do not rely on this antenna to do you the favor of finding the signal. I'll add that you cant use a quality cable (ie Monster) because the cable is hardwired into the antenna at approximately 5' length.
POSITIVE	I am happy with the pot, but haven't been as impressed with this line of Cuisinart cookware. It is fine for my use (boiling pasta, reheating), but I don't use it for my braised dishes. For the price, it was an ok buy.
NEGATIVE	Not so sure about this ..it's a little far out at times definetely for the conspiracy theorists. Does not hold my attention.
NEGATIVE	I have had other issues of this magazine before so I know I will like it once it starts to come.
NEGATIVE	The reason I titled this review 'Disapointed' is because the order was entered on August 9th. I was given a shipping window of August 13 - August 20. I still have not received the product and today is the 22nd. In addition, I sent an e-mail to US Family on August 20th to ask of the status, and never received even an acknowledgement.I have now received an acknowledgement and they had to backorder the item. I will receive it shortly. Today is the 29th of August.
NEGATIVE	"Recorded 43 tracks for the album, I believe it said in the CD insert.... then they must have picked the worst songs they recorded for this album. This album is almost like a collection of B-Sides. Weak, powerless, just going through the motions. Nothing even worth listening to on this album, besides 3 songs, none of which are vintage OLP.I bought this CD for $17 at Best Buy, and I said, ""This CD better be worth it for this insane price!"" Turns out, I got hosed."
POSITIVE	This product came with easy to do instructions. The only complaint I had was that this product did not come with sealing tape...but oh well....a trip to home depot and all was done....This item has numerous settings and does exactly as described..VERY BVERY VERY easy to install.....The only complaint I have is that I wish the hose was Longer....
NEGATIVE	It's not like I had high hopes for this thing. I didn't expect it to last forever, but I expected it to work the first time I tried it. But the mechanism that has the claw- it jammed going side to side the first time I tried the darned thing. Really disappointing too. I wanted to give this to a friend for christmas that loves claw machines- and she's amazingly good at them. I thought this would be a fun little gift for her. Well, I am returning it and I will try a different brand that I can buy in store. If that one doesn't work, it'll be easier to return and I can give her something else instead.
NEGATIVE	"God-awful pseudo-poetry by rock's most over-rated lyricist. The fact that this Rimbaud-wannabe's spoken tripe is considered ""poetry"" by so many people is testament to the moronization of American culture. Buy & read some Keats, Blake, Browning..."
NEGATIVE	tissues of much lower quality ripsThe toy are broken tearsThis game is not good, it is no longer usable after 6 use I do not recommend
POSITIVE	At first, I purchased a couple complete sets of these towels. After they arrived, I was impressed with their quality and I reordered 4 more complete sets. What more can I say; my girlfriend likes using them...
POSITIVE	This is a really good solution to the litterbox scooping problem. It really works just as described. It's made out of sturdy plastic, and was easy to assemble - it took just a few minutes. Very easy to use. Roll it over, roll it back, pull out the drawer, empty the clumps and solid waste into a waste container, replace the drawer, tilt it to the left a bit to level the litter, then add a couple of scoops of fresh litter. It takes literally less than a minute. My cats seem to like it, and it keeps the litter inside the box - one of my cats is an enthusiastic litter-kicker, and usually scatters litter on the floor around an open litter box.I recommend this very highly.
NEGATIVE	"This book utterly lacks any note of credibility. It reads like someone's loony fantasy notion of how 'cool' and 'special' it would be to be seen as a 'recovering alcoholic' -- someone who thus receives full lifetime membership in the ""I'm damaged goods, therefore I am"" club. It's also another symptom of the cancer on the publishing industry: books about nothing more than the author's dreary, vapid life. When are writers going to start writing about subjects worth knowing about and stop taking self-serving advantage of the public's appetite for these cheesy McBooks?"
NEGATIVE	I thought Anthony went down hill with the Fractal mode books and here he puts it into overdrive. Perhaps the authors have too different of styles. Perhaps the first part is too whiny. Perhaps the second part is too boring. But it all adds up to a waste of time and effort.
POSITIVE	Many people have complaints about the plastic part near the metal sliders breaking, I've had these dropped and thrown around on a daily basis for about 2 years and they've never broken. The wires that lead into the jack have ripped apart at the end and the wires are slightly exposed, but nothing a little glue wont fix and a little extra care would ultimately prevent. The only part I would consider poorly constructed is the cloth material that covers the speakers. The cloth hasn't completely come off and probably never will, but it has fallen off enough to where hair and other debree can get underneath and reach the speaker.It would be nice if they where noise cancelling. In a car or on a walk the extra noise makes it diffucult to hear. You might have to turn up your volume to hear and i sometimes fear it might cause hearing damage.Other than that these headphones are excellent.
POSITIVE	This filter was a breeze to install; granted, the old Kenmore brand filter that this new one replaced was installed with quick-release fittings. While the new filter came with nice brass fittings (with the tread already wrapped in teflon tape!), I decided to use my existing quick-release fittings, which allowed me to swap out the filter in less than a minute. So far, it has been a month, and the water tastes great. The 20,000-gallon life span of this filter was a major factor in my decision. I have well water, and this gives me peace of mind, knowing that my water is getting properly filtered. One thing you may want to do: read the instructions. The manufacturer recommends flushing the filter for a few minutes when you first connect it to the supply line to make sure there is no residual charcoal dust coming out of it. This is normal with most water filters and in spite of having forgotten to do that, I did not experience any problems.
POSITIVE	My daughter and husband did not buy at the school book sale. When we needed it it was urgent. Thank you:)
NEGATIVE	"I read this and was quite astonished, to say the least. This is a total rip off of Michael DeGregorio's ""Thunder Bay"".The surf community is small cadre of people and ripping off one of their own is not something to take lightly.If you want the real deal, get the original by DeGregorio."
POSITIVE	At first it was pretty boring.But in the second chapter it became more exciting.There were parts of the book that were very depressing.But this is the type of book that is not afraid of telling it how it is.It talks about some real life situations.I recommend this book to anyone, and especially young people who don't know what some people go through.
POSITIVE	What a true technical gem. Extremely clear articulations, and even more so than any horn player I've ever heard. A real gem for the horn community.
NEGATIVE	"After reading great reviews of this product online, I ordered a Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. for my kid thinking it would make a great birthday present. You're lucky you didn't have to see the pained look on Oliver's face when he got it in the mail yesterday. Apparently, Tuscan doesn't do a good job at making a clear difference between it's whole and 2% models. ""Dad, now all the kids are gonna make fun of me 'cause I'm drinking whole."" Thanks to Amazon for recently posting multiple views of this product online. I hope it helps parents out there when trying to keep up with what's popular these days."
NEGATIVE	A family member loved this movie, and would watch it on a regular basis. It got more unbearable every time. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Don't wait those precious moments of your life watching this.
NEGATIVE	This radio is only good for Sirius. The CD player works on a whim and the controls are so tiny it was like they were designed for a mouse. The remote has never worked, even for selecting stations. No FM/AM reception and I live in a major metropolitan area on the east coast. It is far too big and bulky just for the Sirius part. I kept it tucked in a dark corner its infrequent usage warrants.My only regret about the review is that I cannot give it no stars.
NEGATIVE	The pearls themselves seem to be of decent quality but the strand seems too short, its like a choker and the pearls do not lay straight. Worth the $35 but not a huge bargain for a higher quality piece.
NEGATIVE	They sound muddy, indistinct and filtered, almost as if someone were playing music loudly while you were underwater. The headphones the ipod brings are incomparably better, which should give you an idea as to how horrible this product is. Under no circumstances should you even consider purchasing this.
NEGATIVE	I bought Blue Light blindly and in excitement thinking it was another Easy Rawlins mystery. The color in the title totally threw me off. I couldn't even get myself past the first half. Maybe my pallet was just too ready for more Easy and I never really gave it a chance. I've picked it up again since and just coudln't do it.. lol. I'll leave this one up to you Sci-Fi fans out there. I'll stick to the mysteries and his other novels. Always will be a Walter Mosley fan.
NEGATIVE	I rate this book so low because of the vulgar topics reviewed in the book. Topics involving things that should never be written about. I do not recommend this book to anyone who uphold high morals of language and propriety.
NEGATIVE	This is the conclusion of the Golden Age of the Sith. The Fall is also set 5,000 years before NEW HOPE. While the art work also improves, yes I said improves, the story seems to disintegrate into itself. Since I like some of KJA's work, I am assuming that he was not the lead writer, just placed first alphabetically. Nothing important happens here so don't feel you need to waste your money buying this book, unless you want to buy mine!
NEGATIVE	Ed Yourdon's reputation as a computer expert has been hurt by thisbook. Not only that, but he has stepped out of his expertise to discuss social and economic implications. The book overestimates the impact of Y2K on computers that don't care what date it is. The web-site forum accompanying the book is full of people who have bought the worst-case scenario hook, line, and sinker. If everyone followed their advice, we would all be standing on a mountain in Montana and there would be noone left in the cities to fix the problems that do occur. You can find much more useful info. on the internet. s
NEGATIVE	Buyer beware - I purchased this product as a birthday gift for my mom, but it WOULD NOT work with her iPod Nano even when tested in different vehicles on different stations. Seemed to work fine with my iPod Mini though - makes me wonder if the tuner is too old to work with the newer generation of Nano's.
POSITIVE	I loved this show when it was on television. Then I had to go in for surgery and my cable was all screwed up, so being able to purchase this and watch the entire season was awesome.
NEGATIVE	Thank goodness for sampling, I listened to Cherry Pie by Warrant and that was enough. Not the original artists, don't spend a penny!
NEGATIVE	Coming out is not an excuse to make poor movies like this one,it is slow nad ok when You are 20, but other then that is not really whort it, if You haven seen it, dont worry!
NEGATIVE	Upon receipt of the product, I was extremely disappointed to find that the tablets in the 180 count bottle were half the dose of the tablets contained in the 120 count bottle. Felt deceived.
POSITIVE	Got this slicer as a gift for a friend of mine who eats an apple every day...what a perfect practical gift! The handles are big enough for man-sized hands, unlike the one I personally own, and the only drawback of use he's found so far was that if he leans over too close when slicing an apple, the juice can squirt you in the face! Too funny. :)
NEGATIVE	"Looks a lot like an iPod. I don't like the software as much as itunes. Wouldn't say this was a ""bargain"""
POSITIVE	of how active I am throughout the day. I carry this thing regularly with my wallet and keys. Keeps the last 7 days stored for reference. Takes some time to set up but works well.
NEGATIVE	I borrowed Starcraft and Starcraft: Brood War from a friend and the game is the best computer game in the world. What makes it really special is that you can play it on Battle.net. I couldn't stop playing it till I had to give itback. I like how you get to play three different races instead of just one. This really has a lot to do on Battle.net. I usually had chosen Protoss or Terran. I'm not that good with Zerg, though. Anyway, I just ordered them both and I can't wait to get them!
NEGATIVE	"I was shocked to find out that the author has received awards for her previous biographies. I think this book is poorly written. I don't think there was enough material to write a book here. The author is thorough in listing Billy's ""gigs"" but cannot come up with anything concrete about her personal life. This is not actually the author's fault; however, while researching the topic, she should have realized there was not enough information to write an entire book. So what she does is ask question after question about Billy and even writes passages the way things might have been (but we'll never know, she says). If one has to guess and piece together the way things may have been, why even bother with the subject? One can get more mileage out of a subject like this through fiction (such as ""M Butterfly"" or some of Shakespeare's plays)."
NEGATIVE	This is a horrible product. We are on our third. The rewind doesn't work right. The whole system crashes often. Sometimes shows won't record. I could go on and on. I wish they would just ship me one of the old tivo's, they were so much better. It has gotten to the point where I am so annoyed about this product that I may go back to cable!
NEGATIVE	Interior of book was in OK condition, but the bottom right cover was partly destroyed - the image was peeled off. Disappointed because it was not mentioned on the product specs; it makes a difference to me because I actually use and keep the book for reference and was thinking of giving it after use.
POSITIVE	Susan Reeves managed to create an effective martial arts program based on authentic karate moves without falling prey to the gimmicks of psuedo-kickboxing videos that flood the market today. The focus of the video is on kicking and flexibility. There is also some excercises involving the hands, but the majority draw from use of the feet.Ms. Reeves is a very motivating instructor and her use of Japanese counting to pace the workout is impressive. Each excercise is simple enough to perform, which makes this DVD a recommended purchase for new students. Seasoned martial artists will also find the workout as an excellent supplement for days between sessions at the dojo.
POSITIVE	This was delivered to me within the timeline that was stated. It was in good condition. Thanks!
POSITIVE	I loved this series! Tamera Alexander did it again! I read this series in a matterof days.With each book the story just got better and better. I would recommend this book to anyone.I loved it!!
NEGATIVE	I am probably one of M & P's greatest fans and even I was shocked at how many typo's, complete paragraph errors, etc., that this book has. Hopefully in the second printing, (if there is going to be one) the mistakes will have been edited out. If they are, I am sure that the first edition printings will be a collector's item.
POSITIVE	This book has been a great favorite in my family since my parents received a copy in the late 1940's. I am delighted that it has finally been reprinted! However, I am disappointed that the binding in this edition cuts off part of some of the wonderful illustrations, especially those of the offices of the factory bosses, which take up two pages. In the Third Vice President's office the foreman is almost completely buried in the binding, as is the Third Vice President in both the Second Vice President's and the First Vice President's offices. Otherwise, I am very happy with this book!
POSITIVE	THIS PRODUCT HELPS THE HEALTH OF YOU CAT BY KEEPING THEIR TEETH CLEANMY CATS LOVE IT AS A TREAT EACH MORNING AND THEIR TEETH DO NOT HAVE TARTER BUILD UP
POSITIVE	This is a beautiful game. No question. As a fan of the Dragon Warrior series, I am thrilled to see Enix back in the US, and their first published RPG stateside in 5 years is Valkyrie Profile. The game is gorgeous; the voice-acting is top-notch. I will not rant on about the physical characteristics of the game, though. It is addictive, moving, and epic, and THAT is what RPG fans crave. This game is heartfelt, sweeping, and very entertaining. I can't recommend it enough. Enix returns with a bang, and this game is the start of good things to come! Support Enix and buy their new masterpiece, a sure-fire sleeper hit! You won't regret it! On a side note -- you may want to pick up the strategy guide with the game; while the game is certainly playable without it, there is a steep learning curve, which the guide helps overcome. Order them both on Amazon today!
NEGATIVE	As a former Marine who was schooled in Marine Corps values in Parris Island I felt this book was more a representation of Mr. Millers personal beliefs that over the years he has blended with those he learned in boot camp. The book did not flow very well and was just an OK read.
POSITIVE	Having previously purchased a Shadowline long gown in 2002....I was in desperate need of a new one...with red being my favorite of colors, this was a no brainer. A red Shadowline...hands down!My previous purchase was from a local upscale dept store and through the years it has seen it's share of some rips and tears; however it is still together, just a lot of wearing, but I will not part with it even though it has now been retired.I'm so glad this item was available...and will be a continued customer of Shadowline (until maybe I have every color) and Amazon...amazing service ~
NEGATIVE	I haven't quite finished this book but from what Ihave read(347 1/2 pages)the author has not expressed enough of his natural talents in this book. I think that it will get better as i read more,but from what I have read he could do better.
NEGATIVE	This product arrived with a difficult to adjust temperature control knob and then failed completely within 5 months, destroying an entire curing box worth of salamis and other cured meats. Amazon refused to help rectify the situation, instead giving me the manufacturers phone number and no other help.As a prime member, I can tell you I will NOT be renewing after the crappy customer service I was given.This poorly constructed piece of crp cost me hundreds in product and weeks of work. Don't make the same mistake I did. Purchase a different controller.
NEGATIVE	"This abysmal series smoked donkey nuggets since day 1 os the first disc. I'd review this further, but Eggplant wrote what I was gonna say. Go buy ""Rhythm of Time"" by Jordan Rudess instead."
NEGATIVE	I fell asleep during this. It may have been very good, but I would not rent again just to find out.
NEGATIVE	Rule of the Bone is one of the worst books it has ever been my misfortune to read. The plot is appalingly cliched, the characteres are two dimensional caricatures, and the writing is sloppy, lazy and bereft of skill or style... I'm sorry, remembering the time I wasted reading this excuse for a book is making me feel sick...
NEGATIVE	applied exactly as directions indicate. this product did not remove, nor even affect the scratched area in any way. I recommend not purchasing this product.
NEGATIVE	Trina, Foxy Brown, and Lil' Kim are the original Queen Bees. Khia is a wannabe; she's got the nastiness but lacks the class that Kim, Foxy, and, to an extent, Trina have. And this stuff is really nasty without sounding sexy! It just sounds nasty. And look at the album cover! She's on the floor in this... tacky position. She looks like she just stepped out of the projects and her CD cover looks like it was made in the projects! If she wants to succeed, she needs to get a more feminine voice and needs to borrow some bling from Kim!
POSITIVE	The title says it all. This book had pertinent information related to the course I was taking.
POSITIVE	This is another album that really grabbed me.Magical, mystical, clearly indebted with the late 60's/early 70's acid folk scene, but also very personal and moving.Her voice is peculiar, at times childish while in other moments she sounds almost ghostly. All in all a great album, and another great release for Drag City.
NEGATIVE	As others have said, this set needs recalled. ***DO NOT BUY THIS SET*** The first disc I tried made horrible sounds, and after reading about all the problems everyone else is having I put everything back in the package and returned it for a refund. Such a shame too, I needed many of the movies in this set to complete my Hitchcock collection!
POSITIVE	"Does anybody know where i could get the sheet music for the song that Allie plays on the piano? I believe it's called ""chopsticks"" but i have no clue who the composer is or where i could possibly find it. Thanks!"
POSITIVE	i wait a few days but i recived in perfect conditions is a good toys for kids and for gift is perfect!!!
POSITIVE	I save so much money when I buy my baby's diapers from here and they always ship within 3-4 days.
POSITIVE	A fine little DIY gem from the early 1980s. It shows what people did with lots of vision plus two tin cans and some wire. The track listing above is f***ed up--but wouldn't it be divine to hear the Gun Club do a Meat Puppets song? You should buy this if you are a completist of any of these bands, of LA punk, of scrappy lo-fi scenes. The CD includes very entertaining remembrances on the sleeve of the recording process by some of the band members--even the dead ones! Long overdue.
NEGATIVE	I love fiction and nonfiction books about Queen Elizabeth, Mary Queen of Scots, and their century. But this was a real disappointment. It didn't offer any new understanding of the time period or of Elizabeth or Anne's characters. The love scenes were awkward and embarrasing. They seemed gratuitous and out of place. Thank goodness there are other good books about this period out there. Check out Alison Weir, Reay Tannahill or Patricia Finney for good books set in 16th century England.
POSITIVE	I have owned one of these thumb drives for over a year now and constantly carry it in my jacket pocket and use it on the average of about twice a week to transfer a variety of different files from simple word documents to photographs, software related files, etc. and have had absolutely no problems with it. Other than at times wishing it had the capacity to hold at least another 4 or 5 gigs of information.The only negative thing that I have had happen is that occasionally when transferring file it will sometimes come up with an error message concerning a certain file. When this happens I merely disconnect the thumb drive and then reinsert it and download the files again. This happens rarely, maybe once every 20 or 30 times.Shawn KovacichMartial Artist/Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series.
NEGATIVE	Not a guide on artfully combining different fonts. The book provides the history of where certain types came from, excellent for junkies, unfortunately not for me.
NEGATIVE	I had bought this model after reviewing its specifications on the Amazon website; it seemed well priced for the features that it had. In particular, I wanted a laptop with an in built tv card so that I could watch television programs in my room. When the product arrived, I was extremely disappointed to find that it did not come with the in-built tv tuner as was stated on the Amazon website. I checked the specifications of the model on the official Toshiba website, only to realize that the did not in fact include a tv tuner. I called Amazon and they offered a refund if I returned the product, which was not a viable solution in my opinion (since I had already installed software in the laptop). I would advise anyone keen on getting this model to check the specifications listed on the Amazon website against those on the official Toshiba website. It is extremely disappointing that information on the product was not represented accurately.
POSITIVE	It's a standard oxygen regulator, as an EMT I've used many. I decided to get my own for a jump bag. It's a great price and looks like all of the others our squad has. Fast shipping, ordered on a Thursday, received it on Monday, shipped to NY. I would happily buy again from them.
POSITIVE	These are as fantastic as everyone says they are. I will say though that the sizing is a little off. I wear a 9 or 9.5 in women's shoes and the Large fits perfectly. I tried on an extra large in a store (since that's in line with my normal sizing) and there was a lot of extra space in the back fo the sandal. I'd say you don't need to get XL unless you wear a 10 or above.
POSITIVE	Agree totally with the reviews which claim excellent playing. But, when, oh when will producers try and at least act like music lovers as opposed to trying tio impress with every damn angle they can find? On this particular dvd one is actually treated to viewing the back of some members of the audience's head; then of cousre we must not forget that all of us absolutely love seeing guitar players from the rear, behind their arms, the drummer from ground zero postion, from behind his drum kit, etc, etc. The day a producer locates a decent wide-angle camera and tries to position himself in the centre of the audience in a slightly raised vantage point and helps us view the show as if we were sitting in the centre, taking in as much of the four, five or six members at once the happier I will be. I am not really interested to watch the audience either when Steve or Larry are in the middle of a solo. Get real guys!!
POSITIVE	Quite Ugly One Morning opens with one of the funniest chapters I have read in years. My only mistake was reading it on the train and trying hard to stifle an embarrassing fit of the giggles. I have read two of Christopher Brookmyer's novels and they were fine reads, but this to me was simply pure dead brilliant and in a different class from the others (which I presume must have been written after this). Reminiscent of Ian Banks in its sprinkling of black humour. This is a fine read with solid down to earth characters a fine good-guys v bad-guys sleuth plot and a good dose of West of Scotland sarcasm and whit all thrown into the mix.A rerr terr and a five star jobby.
POSITIVE	I've read quite a few of the Pratchett books, mostly at the insistence of my 13 year old son who loves these novels. This ranks right up there among my favorites, and is intriguing for the allusions to so many of the world's religions. The author is clearly well read, and catching these little references produced many aha! moments, I confess that I even lugged home a compendium on world religion to dig out the paralells and little obscure references - and there is alot more to this book than meets the eye. Well, but in the end, I find myself in complete sympathy with the conclusion, and thus a truly satisfying narrative from start to finish. I should add that this approach to reading this book drove my son absolutely crazy, and in fact taken only at face value, no references or allusions the book is still a great read.
POSITIVE	I am a die hard Steamroller fan, but I am definitely partial to the high energy stuff. This album opens fabulously and then gets real quiet.I can't wait to play Hallelujah on a system that has a sub-woofer. I also like Fum, Fum, Fum; as one of the other reviews said, this reminds me of old Fresh Aire stuff. Most of the rest, however, is very Still (as in Still Nacht). Good background music, but it doesn't move me as much.Listened to the album all the way through twice now. Perhaps additional tracks will grow on me (Hated Little Drummer Boy at first - now its on my favorites list).
POSITIVE	as a fan of a variety of albums off the fabric series, including doc martin, james lavelle, and slam, i instantly purchased the adam freeland disc. working a 8:30 to 5 job i need a quick pick me up in the morning to go with my caffiene and this cd does it for me. its non-stop, constant, and far from boring. though i must say i jump half way through the cd usually because the first couple of tracks kinda drag but are still good. highlights are bassbin twins and adam freelands own tracks. having bought both the tectonics and on tour cds i would say this one is the best with tectonics coming in a close second.
POSITIVE	this disc is excellent! this band knows what it is doing when it comes to rocking. they tend to slow down a bit on song # 6, but they really make up for it with the rest of the album. one cool thing about Jungle Rot is that they stand out from the pack. their music sounds like they're mixing death metal, thrash metal and groove metal together, but they still stomp. I wasn't disappointed with this disc and I hope to hear more from these guys in the future.
NEGATIVE	"The movie Europa, Europa was definatly not the best ""based on a true story"" that I have seen. actually, the documentaries that we watched in history were probably better. If they wanted to make this movie better, the directors would cut out the inappropriate parts (on the train, in the barn, in the bathtub) because they didnt add anything of value and they were kind of disgusting. And if it was a true story, i really dont see how soloman could still be alive after everything that happened to him. I just dont think its possible for one teenager to betray so many people and get away with it. There is a line that he crossed, he should of remembered his religion and his family and stopped being so selfish. So overall, this movie kind of sucked.he totally should have followed our motto- death B4 disloyalty."
NEGATIVE	Dr. Anthony clearly means well, but this volume was a waste of time for me. It is a loosely organized collection of pithy and obvious observations, anecdotes and truisms. There isn't an original idea or suggested approach in here--in spite of the great title.
NEGATIVE	In short pass. I watched this drivel with my mother over the holidays thinking it would be a wonderful chic flick with beautiful travel cinematography. It was terribly boring, no great travel shots and a waste of our time. Neither my mother nor myself are fans of Julia Roberts but thought perhaps this movie might be fine because of the travel. I only paid $1 from the kiosk rental but still not worth it. Save your money and time - even if on sale. I agree with another reviewer the companions in Italy were the most interesting part of the movie but never really developed the characters. The reason for the main character's up and leaving husband - the hopping in/out of bed from husband to flaky actor to sensual Javier Bardem. I could not emphathize with the character. Too self absorbed and she brought the unhappiness upon herself. For a similar chic flick I'd rather watch Under the Tuscan Sun which had a nice ensemble of characters that were allowed to develop; not Eat Pray Love.
NEGATIVE	I bought the IBOD Airbrush Tanning system. When I got the item and went to use it i found out that a special plug in (230 Volt) was needed. I dont know if I was missing a part with this package or what was going on because the instruction said use a standard outlet but it didn't work. I never got to use the product but if anyone wants to buy it for personal use make sure you BUY the IBOD PERSONAL AIRBRUSH TANNING SYSTEM. That one clearly says you can use a 110 volt outlet which is standard.
POSITIVE	I highly recommend this book to any classic movie lover. It is well-researched, informative, and entertaining. Unlike several other books of its kind, the two authors, in addition to covering the actresses' personal lives, also take the pains to explore and discuss the characters whom these women portrayed. In several instances, they lift direct dialogue from the films themselves to elaborate on their roles. What is the end result after reading this volume? Like me, I think you may find yourself trying to see as many of these films as you can! I anxiously await future writings from both Laura Wagner and Ray Hagen.
POSITIVE	"""Halloween is a fun type of scary,"" says Instructor Ann Felice in this holiday-themed edition of Let's Create. Featuring a spooky soundtrack and filled with fun facts about Halloween, this video entertains kids while teaching them all kinds of imaginative tricks and treats. Some of the art projects featured include:--flying tissue-paper ghosts--scary skeletons made from straws--pumpkin windsocks created using paint and paper bags--fun noisemakers, using paper plates and pebbles, rice or dried macaroni--and a lot more!"
NEGATIVE	"If you want to see your face while putting on make up I would not suggestthis iem. The mirror itself is about 6 1/2"".If Women like to put their make up and check th entire face while doing so,this is not the mirror to purchase.Very dissatisfyed with mirror size"
POSITIVE	I've only one thing to say - I've seen it 5 TIMES!!! And I have already pre. orderd it!
NEGATIVE	I bought this for my Kindle due to the excellent reviews for the Musa version without looking at the sample first. Once I opened it up, it was clear that this is NOT the Musa version but a straight translation by Longfellow, which is far, far from what I was looking for. I'm calling customer service about this. The $2 for the Kindle version isn't the point, but it isn't even CLOSE to what the reviews match too. And when typing in Musa's name for a search, this is the only link that comes up. Very disappointing from such a stellar organization like Amazon.
NEGATIVE	Could some one send me the add that shows me my saw as being advertised as no battery and charger?????????
POSITIVE	Education for Extinction is a book about the Boarding School Experience of American Indians. The book is one that will bring you to tears, but it also shows the incredible resiliency of the children who endured the Boarding School Experience. This book is a true portrayal of the Boarding School experience; the good, the bad, and the ugly. This book gives you a harsh look at why Indian Boarding Schools were created in the first place and the connection between American Exceptionalism and colonization. I recommend this book if you are willing to take a harsh look at the oppression of American Indians.
POSITIVE	Captain Aubrey raises his Commodore's broad pennant for the first time. He finds commanding a single ship under his sole control less frustrating than dealing with the personalities of subordinant captains and commanders. The exotic locale and historical accuracy of this little known British adventure are well told in a fictionalized account inserting Aubrey and Maturin. A personal favorite.
POSITIVE	I bought this for my husband who has had the the same one for about 10 years. His finally stopped keeping a charge and he lost all his data. Figured it was time for a new one. He uses the watch as his calendar and date organizer. He puts all his appointments into the watch. The watch front shows the whole week as little boxes along the top and little ovals will appear in the boxes if you have set an appointment for that day. He uses it daily and also keeps notes on his watch. The only problem he has had is the watch is plastic and the black paint will wear off. The watch band also will break but you can get a cloth/leather replacement band and it will last for alot longer. The watch is waterproof as far being able to be able to go in the shower. I wouldn't recommend going swimming with it. Overall it is a great watch, but would recommend buying a new watch band for it. I would give it 5 stars if the body was made out of metal.
POSITIVE	I have had the GN9350 for 3 weeks now and the call quality is great! People do not know I'm on a wireless headset. I have only wander about 100 feet from the base but, it has been in a house so, the signal has had to go through walls and I have not been dropped or had call quality issues.This headset is compatible with many forms of communication hardware and software. Because of this, it gets a little confused as to what it is supposed to do in a given situation straight out of the box. It can be adjusted but, it takes some trial by adjusting the headset and your particular software to get it dialed in. If you are not tech-savy, this may get a little frustrating! If you do take the time, it works as advertised.
POSITIVE	This one is more Digital and Drum and Bass than Ha, so If you like Ha for that reason you will love this. He also has a little more humor with his mixes on this CD and seems to enjoy catching the listener off guard. Talvin is a fantastic Artist, I will always be a fan. This CD is fun and worth owning.
NEGATIVE	I thought I was ordering an XBox controller. Instead I got a controller that was made by Pelican. It does work with the XBox but within two days the protective covering over the drive control had torn and fallen off leaving a very sharop edge that cuts into your thumb. Now have to wear a bandaid over thumb to use control.. Also the drive control has become very loose and we are wondering just how long it will last. If I had known this was not an XBox controller, I probably would have searched further until I found the correct one. This is the first time I hae been disappointed in any product I have ordered from Amazon, I realize this product came from a different supplier but thought since Amazone endorsed it, it would be alright. I probably will continue to order from Amazon, but will be more careful if item is from an outside supplier.
POSITIVE	While this is not the best written book in Oprah's Club, the story, the character developement and reality of those characters is magnificent. If there has ever been any kind of crisis in your family - read this! Don't be turned off by the Author's poor showing on Oprah, she wrote a really good book.
NEGATIVE	"I give it 2 stars only because it was free. The illustrations are poor, and the 'poems' are pretty awful. it says on the back cover, in all caps,""WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND"" I think that's pretty creepy for a preschooler's book. Clearly this is a 'traditional' family values kind of book, and doesn't come across as being very accepting. In it's favor is that it is easy to read, and the concepts are very clear, though sometimes a little weird."
NEGATIVE	"I was amazed that my primary suspect in the first third of the book was pretty much confirmed midway through, and I kept thinking ""there has to be a twist here, it couldn't be that obvious!"" There was indeed a twist, which I didn't predict, but it didn't shake me from simply revising my theory, which turned out to be correct.There are some love scenes in the book which certainly don't detract from the overall work, but are so briefly written, it makes me think they are written by someone with no more experience than reading Penthouse Forum.All that said, the book is well constructed, with workmanlike pacing and plotting. I think it simply lacks imagination."
POSITIVE	I have always considered myself a fan of all types of music I have heard. From rap to classical, I have cds of them all. When I first heard Mummer's Dance (Book of Secrets) on VH1 I couldn't have not bought Book of Secrets even if I was bankrupt. The Visit and Mask and Mirror were bought a month later. This is a cd that all people should get, no matter what music you listen to.
NEGATIVE	The card was good while it lasted but I expected a life cycle of greater than 1 year.
NEGATIVE	Well, where do I start? These guys play about as well as a garage band. They have very basic skills. The guitar playing especially blows. A blind monkey could play better than these guys. As for the songwriting, it seems to be the work of 8th graders. Absolutely juvenile. This band fits right in with all the other garbage that is being foisted off on us, with sloppy playing, poor writing, and confusing foul language with truly making a social statement
POSITIVE	Better than a smelly pan sitting on the counter. With the liners it is easy to take to the backyard composter.
NEGATIVE	This review is for the PC demo-version of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Pro:Graphics is great,Sound is good,Cons:Like Goblet of Fire the control-sytem is not designed for PC,Here are list of problems:1- keyboard and mouse not configurable,2- Cannot use mouse to look around (ie control camera).3- When turning mouse gestures off, there is no other functions will be assigned to it.4- The camera does not follow behind the character (it is not the familiar third person camera).Bottom line:The control makes the game hard to play and take the fun out of it,My suggestion is try the demo before you buy it.
POSITIVE	I usually take this when i start out to work.and by the time i get there (40 min). i'm usually VERY READYEMOTIONALLY to deal with whatever STRESS comes my way.I'm now very calm at work and able to deal with anything.THIS STUFF WORKS!!!!
NEGATIVE	I bought this book and was completely blow off by the amount of false information. I am a R.I. (Ranger Instructor) here at Fort Benning and have met the author. I feel Robert Bertrand is trying to a make a quick buck on selling false information to easy prey. Please do your own research before buying this book like I should have.
NEGATIVE	I've had this cord for a few years . It worked good , but when the ground plug fell out i realized that the home depot and lowe's stopped selling them . I have been e- mailing coleman cable ( found they made this )and never have gotten a reply . Now I know why the big stores don't sell them . There is no customer service ! Maybe this review will get their attention . Buyers beware of these people . When I bought this I thought there was a warrentee . Guess not !
NEGATIVE	a decent game, but hardly better then 3 out of 5. for that reason it gets a 1.
NEGATIVE	this last bottle came witha ton of broken caplets which means that I got jiped and everytime I get any out, i get covered in the dust(ingrdiants). I would like to be compensated.
POSITIVE	I have always been a big Bowie fan, but I came along later in his musical career. In fact, Let's Dance was my 1st introduction to Bowie when I was about 12, so it always has a special place in my heart. The only earlier Bowie I listened to for a long time was from his greatest hits, Changes One. Anyway, I finally began collecting his earlier stuff and now own most of his pre=80's cannon. I never bought Let's Dance on cd, so when it came out as a hybrid SACD, I decided to get it. I don't have the original cd to compare it,with, but the SACD sounds great. Incredibly clear, incredibly crisp sound. Unfortunately, they released this as a 2-channel stereo SACD instead of the multi-channel, so it is limited in that regard. However, it sounds great and highly recommended.
NEGATIVE	Like the other reviewer, the one I received would not load a CD. This was a Christmas gift request, but we are sending it back and plan to shop for another brand.
POSITIVE	The Alfa AWUS036H is one of few electronic items that's cheap and done so so so many cool thinks ,,,Oasis Computers gives 6 stars !
NEGATIVE	Don't waste one of your nine lives listening to this album. If you're not a cat then you have even more to lose. This is not one of Aerosmith's better albums. Whilst granted there is some nice artwork in the CD cover the actual CD hasn't had much work put into it at all. There are no songs on here that could be deemed classics. It's pretty hard to even say any of them are worthwhile having on as background music. This album is very disappointing being that Aerosmith have created so many huge hits and great albums.
NEGATIVE	I purchased this product as a spare. I left it in my garage in the box and when I needed it because my other unit failed, it had been a few weeks over a year since its purchase. I plugged it in and the fan worked the display functioned, everything appeared fine. The unit never produced an ounce of water. I called the warranty people at the company, and they were unresponsive and curt. Said if I mailed the unit at my expense 800 miles to some service center that they might cover the parts depending on which parts had failed. Do youself a favor and look at another brand of dehumidifier.
NEGATIVE	I am a long time subscriber to Cooks Illustrated and love it - so I tried this. I think it's a waste of money. Too many glossy recipe cards (where are the environmentalists on that staff???) and the size is too large for my collection of standard size cooking magazines. The consumer articles are on kitchen sponges vs. the real cooking equipment you find in Cooks Illustrated. Skip it. I had hoped for something that did good meals for families and find a glossy thingy that seems entirely aimed at the nostalgia market. There are numerous better choices, including the fine Cooks Illustrated, Cooking Light or Fine Cooking.
POSITIVE	I am a teacher and I have seen this movie 8 times! I wish the world could be made to watch this movie and understand its importance. I wish people could see that jeremy stands for all the downtrodden and misunderstood people of the world. People should watch and understand that the way Jeremy was treated is the way African Americans are treated, Indians are treated, women, Jews, homosexuals, mentally impaired persons, old people, and anyone else society perceives as being different than they believe to be normal.When I saw this movie for the first time I remember thinking that the author was a genius and because I like to write also I wished I could write something so insiteful, powerful and moving as he had. This is truely the greatest movie ever!
POSITIVE	This book had me wanting more. Since it is a true story it made me want to find Mr. Rourke and see what he can do for me. Keesha
NEGATIVE	"Thie product I bought was advertised as ""new"" and in original box. The product I received had no serial number and therefore was not part of the normal market. I returned it to Amazon and had no problem doing so."
POSITIVE	Both gameboy advance and gamecube is out cold. Besides at stores it cost 200$ while xbox and ps2 is 300$ and the cd is 2 inches smaller then the other 2 systems. Also the controller is more comfortable too. And in the future, there will be the wireless controller from wave bird so you won't dhassle with cords. I recomend that you shold get the gamecube.
POSITIVE	First I will tell you I'm not a vegetarian/vegan. I really love the simplcity of the recipes in the magazine and the ideas it gives me of things I can also modify into non-veggie dishes. If you are looking for a food magazine that gives you a flare for something different I totally recommend this.
NEGATIVE	I'm a big fan of LG, but I can only remember the cover picture & the bare plot of this book & nothing else bcs. this was an utterly forgettable story....
POSITIVE	THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. IT'S FUNNY, VERY ORIGINAL, AND IT KEPT ME INTERESTED. IF YOU'RE A DOG LOVER AND ARE LOOKING FOR A BOOK, A good BOOK, I highly SUGGEST THIS. Patrick Jennings DOES A GOOD WRITNG JOB, AND WHEN I READ IT, I WAS really LAUGHING!!! SO THREE WORDS: READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
POSITIVE	This book was on the requirement list to enter Honors English I in my town's high school. I found the book very intriguing. It shows you both life at its worst, and at its best. (Please don't ask me to elaborate :) !) The book also gives you an outlook on human nature as a whole. I found this book to be one of the most touching stories I have ever had the priviledge to read.
POSITIVE	I just bought it and it has arrived today and its already paid it's self off.I fixed three of my xbox360 games one of which was really badly scratched. I am in love with this product! The noise is loud , but who cares it's not loud enough to not make me wan't to buy it. Buy this machine it works great!
NEGATIVE	the first dozen pages were brilliant. 90% of the books is lousy writing and a miserable read.she could be likeable but seems cold-hearted: for example: she doesn't feel sorrow over the two orphans in wayan's shop whom wayan seems to have taken in simply to work as free cooks and housekeepers for her and her shop. the author mentions that wayan doesn't include these poor 'orphans' in the new house purchase and the author doesn't really mind. i bet those 2 poor, abused homeless children are not in wayan's house now (there is a small chance she kept them on as servants after the book was published and widely read). that is just the type of thing the author is unintelligent and insensitive about.she is an oaf. an emotionally rough yet weak person. she obsesses on a random person and gloms onto that person 24/7 to an embarassing extent.
NEGATIVE	This is the worst and most expensive DVD player I've bought. I wanted the DVD recorder. Shortly after the warranty period ended the problems began. The DVD door sticks. The remote works sporadically. The record timer shuts off early. And just to add insult to injury the DVD locks up now. No more Go Video machines for me!
POSITIVE	With hindsight, it's really quite remarkable how Trotsky was able to understand so vividly the course the Soviet Union was taking and the disastrous consequences that would then ensue. Anyone interested in the history of Stalinist Russia should at least glance through this book. Trotsky offers not only a detailed analysis of the Soviet Union under Stalin, but an interesting critique as well. Finally, perhaps the most interesting factor in Trotsky's book is how he almost seems to forecast the end of the USSR...nearly 50 years in advance.
POSITIVE	"You can really never beat the incredible duo of Anna Moffo and Franco Corelli singing the title roles. I'm biased to both - Moffo is my favorite soprano with her creamy voice and dramatic ability. Corelli, for his sheer animal magnetism and intensity of performance. I've never been a fan of Bizet's ""Carmen"". For some reason, I just never liked operas sung in French. And I took French in school and enjoyed it. Somehow, operas just sound more beautiful and melodic in Italian. Anyways, the music is lovely as Bizet did have a way with melody. The leads truly make this a memorable performance as they did not sing together much at all during their respective careers. I wish they did.Corelli sounds like a jealous man and possessed too! Moffo is her usual gorgeous self - the warm and seductive voice with it's elegant phrasing."
NEGATIVE	I purchased this OXO shaker based on the current review in the Saveru 100 and because of many other great products I own from OXO. The product leaks like several other cocktail shakers I already own. I was trying to eliminate the leaking problem I already have so I'm returning it. Too bad because otherwise it's a nice looking product and I like the double-walled feature. I would also say the jiggered lid is not very useful for any serious measuring since its only 1 ounces to the top.
POSITIVE	It's very nice...but like others said...the alarm is not very loud.It's like a wrist watch alarm!I have a wood furnace, and when the electricity goes off it would heat up real fast.This is a good product to alarm me to close it down!
POSITIVE	It is not as bad as I said below. I just had to get used to it. Although a copy of the original recording of these songs would be better, this is pretty good.
POSITIVE	I, too, suffer from OCD and I could relate so well to her rituals and phobias. Perhaps she seems unbelievable to those who have never suffered from or encountered another person who suffers from OCD, but the behavior is just as odd as Griffin portrays it.
NEGATIVE	You have as much chance of urinating against the side of Voyager Two than winning the national lottery. Never the less, my mate Nigel 'spunky' Turner says that when, not if, he wins it he will buy a copy of every great film Arnold Schwarzenneger has made over the last thirty years and then buy himself a large country estate to put them all in. Well, that takes care of the doorstop......
NEGATIVE	Keep in mind the new tradeskill interface was NOT included only with the Gates of Discord expansion; the new interface was made available to everyone.I didn't buy the GoD expansion and I am happy that I didn't. Most of what I've heard from friends and guildies is that the expansion just wasn't worth it. Nerfing the vendor buy price on fish along with SOE's massive tribute point reduction that was made *after* everyone turned in a good amount of plat and items was just low.I've read that SOE is working on fixing some of the content so that casual players can begin to get more from this expansion instead of just ONE hunting zone. Until they do that or once it shows up in the $9.99 bargain bins I would suggest not buying this expansion.
NEGATIVE	"International word lists were an interesting appendix to 1995's ""The Windows Interface Guidelines for Software Design,"" but two years earlier were put together for this book. It presents Windows 3.1 terms translated to 14 languages, sorted both by alphabet and by category. These lists seem a big waste of space, especially as they're also present on an attached diskette. However, first thirty pages slightly redeem the book, containing a condensed round-up of popular and obscure graphical elements of Windows 3.1 -- with a lot of illustrated examples."
NEGATIVE	"I was wanting to replace my waffle iron but didn't want to store anything else. Then I saw the new Foreman with the interchangeable plates. We love it. It's so easy to use and to clean.The recipes I read kept saying to spray the meat with Pam before cooking! I had always sprayed the plates, not the meat, but this works great!I also purchased the omelet plates and I like those too, but I wish I had a rack for all the plates or an easier and less ""space taking"" way to store them! Still, I love the product.Addition to review: I just looked at this review for the first time and saw it has one star. That's a mistake, which it won't let me correct now! I really give it a 5 star rating!"
POSITIVE	I have only used this a couple of times as of yet,I first ran some really rough oak through it,next was some walnut and I am really impressed with how well it planes in both instances. I really can't tell any real difference between the quality of cut using the slower( more cuts per min.) speed rather than the faster one. Really like this machine!Perhaps even more stars are to be rewarded for their prompt customer service. The unit arrived with a broken gear case cover. Going to their web site gave me the part number and a short email explaning the damage in transit resulted in receiving the replacement in just a few days. There may just be a place for some other yellow tools in my shop as a result.I have read of problems with the blades wearing too fast, and I guess time will only tell there.
POSITIVE	A great little find. We needed a new humidifier because I dropped the water reservoir on our other humidifier. It was also an ultrasonic (the only kind we use) but had a more standard shape. I had to twist my husband's arm to get this style, but he gave in and as soon as we hooked it up, it started working wonderfully and we both agreed that it was much quieter than our other humidifier.
POSITIVE	I have owned this knife since February 2004 and it is still in great condition. I have used it to cut small tree branches, cut screws, and have used about every other tool on the knife. Nothing will kill this knife. The only thing about it that can be a weakness is the spring on the scissors. It broke after a few years and you can buy a replacement kit from Victorinox for....$67....don't think so... Despite that, the knife is brilliant. Always sharp and easy to care for. A little warm water and oil now and then will keep this, and any Victorinox, working for many, many years.
NEGATIVE	Brought up in a Christian environment but denounce faith as I believe myself a little more scientific and pragmatic need-to-see-to believe person than my family should make me game for such a book. Instead, I fell asleep going through the first few chapters. Poor arguments which sometimes shoots itself in the toes. Here is one disarrayed writer instead of a lawyer proving his case. Sheesh... if I could return this book.
NEGATIVE	for the price i paid i figured i was going to get what was on the pic not 2 single strips. this is the last time you will get any service from you freaking bunch of thieves.
POSITIVE	Wow!!!! This book is as much an art book as it is a knitting pattern book. It is beautiful to look at over and over again.It is not for any but the most experienced knitters and even then it can be formidable.However, it is inspirational, challenging, and beckons me to improve my knitting skills so I can tackle some of the most beautiful color patterns I have ever seen!I highly recommend this book.
POSITIVE	"If you took Thee Headcoatees, the Frumpies and surf music and threw them into a psychotic blender, you might get the Trashwomen. An offbeat, often playful mix of songs, ""Spend the Night..."" is a short, quick burst of yowling energy. The only downside to this obscure jewel is that it's under a half-hour and quite a few of the songs are instrumentals. But even with that and the challenge you'll encounter trying to find it, it is still worth your time. If the sun rises and sets for you with the punk screech of a female, this is for you. Now let's hope someone releases the rest of the Trashwomen oeuvre on CD."
NEGATIVE	I love and adore Jimmy Stewart; I always have and always will. His movies are timeless and his humanity and humility, as an actor, are inspirational to people everywhere. However, it is clear to me that Mr. Krueger's Christmas is nothing less than Mormon propaganda produced for the specific purpose of advertising and exploiting a particular religious view as opposed to the universalism of the true Christmas story that surely embraces all humankind.
POSITIVE	I love this book and it's my favorite present for boys or girls from 2 to 5 years old. It's a great simple story that will make your child smile and think. And I guarantee that you will also enjoy and learn from Winnie's experience.
NEGATIVE	"I know what you're thinking, ""wait a second, it's Cheech and Chong, how could it suck?"" Well, they aren't the old Cheech and Chong anymore, they are ""old"". This whole thing was somewhat painful to watch as they just seemed like they were trying to act like the characters they used to play. It was like watching some pretty good Cheech and Chong impressions. I've seen worse stuff out there, but in the world of Cheech and Chong this is somewhat depressing, stick to the oldies."
POSITIVE	Just looking at this game's screenshots is enough to make someone want to buy this game. It truly harnesses the graphic prowess of the Xbox processer. But, of course, graphics don't make a game. With this game series' excellent history, however, I doubt there is much to worry about with how this game turns out.If you are the type of buyer that uses Amazon's star rating system to decide whether or not to buy a game, disregard it on this one. The person who gave this a one-star rating obviously didn't rate it right, because in his review, he praised the game.This game will almost undoubtitely live up to its predecessor's legacy. It's a must-buy.
NEGATIVE	"There is some good information here but I got real turned off by the ""infommercial"" tone and the testimonials. All but the Thought form spell one can get in better books."
POSITIVE	"...And David MORSE ! ... This tall man has killed his child, his son, and ever since this time he has ONE idea ! ONE project in his mind: "" KILL HIM WHEN HE WILL GO OUT THE PRISON "" He has lost anything, his wife, his comfort, his welfare when this man who was drunken at the time of facts and his revenge is puting near day after day this is an obsession for him, he go to advertise his almost former wife who he is outdoors but after a follow-up he doubt of himself, because his enemy goes around the tomb of his child while him himself has never made that this is a sort of redemption for these two men and mostly a forgiveness for the killer ! Jack NICHOLSON and David MORSE are perfects in this DVD MOVIE FILM ! ********** A GOOD TEAM"
NEGATIVE	only worked twice, then stopped. not worth it. i would not recommend this product there are other more expensive which will work better
NEGATIVE	"This is an infomercial and not much more. Nikon does themselves a disservice charging for this video as it leaves you with a sour feeling having spent $25-$30 on what should have been included with your Nikon camera (Tip to Nikon Marketing: include the video with the camera and a discount coupon for ""A Hands-on Guide to Creative Lighting"" and you'll see much more revenue from flash sales than you will with lame DVDs .That said, the Creative Lighting System itself is excellent, but get the instruction you are looking for from this DVD: ""Nikon School presents A Hands-on Guide to Creative Lighting"".After you've seen that one then head over to [...] to really delve into the possibilities. Save your money on ""Speed of Light"" though.Nikon, these are the kind of money grubbing gimmicks that erode brand equity over time. You can do better."
POSITIVE	This is a very good reference material for someone exploring the opportunities in the wedding business. The book has several sample forms and a thorough appendix. More of an emphasis is placed on the buisness aspect of wedding consulting.
NEGATIVE	... I had great hopes for this production. I saw it on Broadway, and was disappointed in the loss of Gospel of Judas... Hoping the DVD would be more noteworthy, I purchased for my collection - it retained the dullness that was not part of the, in my opinion, original intent of Lloyd/Rice. rather than completing Judas' story (his self-murder) the story ends simply with the crucifixion. A shame and travesty. Hey, Sir Andrew: Why the re-write?
NEGATIVE	These have a very different feel from the metal brushes I have used, but they have some practical advantages.One minor downside on this particular set was that the end caps came off in my hands as soon as I started playing. They were very poorly glued on, but remounting with more and better glue solved this problem. I did not experience this with another set I bought.
NEGATIVE	I bought this for my husband for Christmas being that he is a huge Dallas Cowboys fan and after 2 weeks the Cowboys emblem fell off! Now all we have is a coffee mug with a glue spot on it. Should have spent less money and got something that was engraved into the stainless steel! NOt recommended!
POSITIVE	I bought this for my toddler. It is cute and the songs are catchy. It holds his attention for the full half hour. I would recommend it to anyone.
NEGATIVE	A lot of people here seem to really like the smell of this cleaner, and you can't argue with such a subjective assessment. I personally think it smells absolutely vile. This cleaner does not smell like almonds, it smells like very strong baby oil, so strong that the whole house smells like it for hours. To me this is nauseating. I hate to throw it away; maybe I will use it only before going out of the house somewhere. YMMV of course. Works fine to clean wood, but leaves the surface sticky for a while.
POSITIVE	Great read!! I have read many books on Jamaica and I have to rate Walk Good towards the top. Jamaica is my passion.
POSITIVE	We loved every one of these in the trilogy. Cannot wait to own it. A family favorite for sure! We have watched these over and over again and they never get old.
POSITIVE	Jason Mraz has a beautiful voice. He sings not only lyrics but you can hear the individual notes. His music is new, full of beat. I sometimes hear parts of Queen and ELO back in his songs. This is a compliment. I play it in the car a lot and it makes me feel good.
NEGATIVE	"Are these people who are writing these reviews you see boring sacks or am I missing something? This book is not ""laugh out loud funny"" or ""so funny I had to put the down"". This book just isn't funny. It's a mildly entertaining story, maybe for kid (the text is huge and it's only 150 or so pages).DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! Amazon has so much more great books to offer.Detective Burley is a crappy character and the stories about him really aren't worth a intelligent person's time."
POSITIVE	One of the most touching movies I ever seen.Those that know the area of the globe (small frontier towns between Uruguay and Brazil) can appreciate the realism of this movie depicting the people, social life, struggles, and geography; for those that do not know the area, this movie is an enjoyable learning experience.Only these excellent actors could bring this excellent story (base on actual events) to the screen with such level of realism and entertainment value.
NEGATIVE	But that's all I needed to hear. I hear no originality. Sounds like Horse and Cariage by Camron. Why is Janet in this song. Why is JaRule and Eve in this song. Is this a joke. Nice video though. I need another single before I even review the rest of this album please.
NEGATIVE	I've owned the Maverick for three years. The receiver constantly loses it's connection to the transmitter. Not very handy when using in conjunction with a smoker. Save your money and buy a conventional thermo such as Polder, Taylor or Pyrex. I have several of each and they have worked faithfully for years. One Polder is probably 20 years old and it's still tickin'.
POSITIVE	Besides great Richard Scarry stories, there is even a game inside! It is a very fun Christmas time story book.
NEGATIVE	If your a twelve year old boy....you'll love it.Other than that...save your money.Surprised Alba did this as there is nothing to recommend it.
NEGATIVE	It broke after about 30 shuffles. Spend a little more a find a more durable shuffler. It's not worth the time to repackage it for a replacement. Amazon is the best for returns can't complain about that.
NEGATIVE	Terrible product! I was reading the label to see why this would be considered a good thing to give to children and I am shocked at how much pure garbage is in it--junk soy protein, artificial colors and flavors...NOT something that should be marketed as healthy for children. You would be better off giving them an organic yogurt shake.
NEGATIVE	The concept is marvelous -- there are so many situations in life where some sparkling conversation starters would be most helpful. If... has some imaginative questions to get discussion flowing and I appreciate that. However, by the time I eliminate the endless variations on the same theme, the old, overused standbys (If you could have dinner with any one person in history...) and the many sexual topics(including desired lovers, simultaneous lovers, same gender lovers, who you'd like to see naked and more), I'm left with only a few questions I will actually use.
NEGATIVE	"Out of the 28 stories in this book, I found only about 5 to be well-written and humorous. The majority of the rest consisted of stories about intimate bodily fluids and functions that just happened to occur on foreign soil, and frankly, I found them disgusting and boring. After a while, I started skipping stories entirely after reading the first paragraph or two and seeing where they were headed. I was very disappointed.If you enjoy travel narratives, a much better compilation of women's stories can be found in ""A Woman's Passion for Travel"" edited by Marybeth Bond & Pamela Michael. Although that book doesn't claim to be a collection of funny stories, ""Sand in my Bra"" really isn't a collection of funny stories, either."
POSITIVE	I have to admit that I'd really only give this book 3.5 stars, but that's not an option... It's a really good book and I do recommend it to anyone interested in Hawaii, but I just couldn't get lost in it like I did with other Michener novels.The story follows the history of Hawaii from volcanic formation to statehood. Though it is entirely about Hawaii, a surprising amount of the story takes place outside of Hawaii. Aside from the obvious connections to Tahiti, there's also plenty of info on New England, China and Japan. You'll learn about agriculture, politics, religion, and most of all - people.If you aren't particularly interested in Hawaii but want to experience a great Michener novel, take a look at Carribean, Chesapeak, or Alaska.
POSITIVE	"764-Hero is John Atkins and Polly Johnson, and like another NW band the Spinanes, create songs without a bassist. While the songs on this album do contain pop hooks, they are usually buried under various levels of noise and overtones. Atkins' voice warbles and occasionally screams, as on the opening noise-rock feast ""Comb the Carpet"", but occasionally hits some soft notes too, as on the albums closer which pairs an acoustic guitar with extraneous synthesizer noise. ""Wait Until 5"" and ""Check the Address"" are a little more poppy that the other songs, my favorite is ""I'm Lying"" which features Polly's dad Ward on organ, who coincidentally also used to be an Amazon employee."
NEGATIVE	"I used to love this movie. I think all of the acting is excellent, and that it perfectly portrays the suburban ennui of Connecticut in the 1970s that, albeit in a different form, still exists to this day. My complaint is this: I searched for ""weather in New Canaan, Connecticut, November 23, 1973"" in Wolfram Alpha recently (Novemebr 23 being the date of the titular ice storm) and the result I got was -- are you ready for this? -- ""temperature average: 48 F, conditions: fog, overcast, cloudy, partly cloudy, few clouds, clear."" That, my friends, is a far cry from an ice storm. It is sad to see a movie go so far in recreating a historical period -- costumes, Watergate hearings, houses, even waterbeds -- and get this one crucial piece so very wrong. For shame, Rick Moody and Ang Lee!"
POSITIVE	I bought this along with the side firebox. I have owned it for a year or so now and still love it. It works great for smoking your favorite foods. It was pretty simple to assemble and well made. For the price you cannot go wrong. It is my first smoker and so far its holding up great. It looks really nice too. I recommend this product. Any questions please ask i am always looking for advice so i enjoy giving it when i can as well.
NEGATIVE	This movie is BORING and TERRIBLE.....lacking in action, poor acting and terrible movie overall. I wasted my time and money ......DONOT BUY THIS MOVIE.
POSITIVE	God, this is a wonderful camera. It's small, it's light, and it's got a genuine wide angle lens. You can still together shots for a 180 degree view, which is truly nifty, and it's got video capability and everything. On mine, however, the LCD screen proved vulnerable for reasons yet to be determined but depending on Kodak's response, I'm reserving judgement. These are awfully awfully nice cameras, tiny and high quality. I'd have a hard time getting anything else after this experience, even with the screen self destructing.ETA: and the kodak people were just wonderful, the camera was fixed, and I am happy all over again.ETA #2: The lenses are both digital, which means the camera's profile is flat all the time. A great advantage.
NEGATIVE	The only difference here is that Raymond Benson, who is now writing the Bond novels penned this one. The problem with Benson is not his knowledge or understanding of James Bond but HIS WRITING. It's bad. Bottom line. The guy is a lousy prose writer, sounding like a high school English student in his explanations of scenes and descriptions. There is not an iota of drama or even action here. It's just plain wording of scenes on a page. This book is only of interest to big fans of the movie (which was top-notch Bond) and of the novels (for completists, as Benson's other 2 novels blow this turkey away.)
POSITIVE	"John Sanford has two talents that set him apart from many of the current mystery writers populating the bookstore shelves. First, he finds ""different"" plots. Sanford doesn't rely on the same well-worn hashed-over plots that most writers use. No serial killers here (well that may be arguable), at least the sociopathic type we are most often presented. ""Hidden Prey"" offers a cold-war survivor's tale that resembles some of the work of John le Carre.Second, Sanford has an ability to make every character seem real. The reader gets to know even minor characters.The best aspect of this story may be found in a sub-plot that encompasses serrendipitous redemption.However, I have one complaint. The explanantion of the central plot mystery is disposed of in one paragraph. I think Mr. Sanford could have embellished this a bit, to at least provide some details of the conumdrum faced by the sympathetic villian.All in all, pretty good."
NEGATIVE	One Star for this collection - here we are 2 years later and the bozo's at Fox still aren't listening - PUT A 'PLAY ALL' FEATURE ON THESE DVD'S!!! - other than that they're great
POSITIVE	FOR ALL THEM PLAYA HATERS YEAH YOUR GIRL MIGHT LIKE LOOKING AT GINUWINE; BUT IF YOU HANDLING YOUR BUSINESS THEIR AINT NOTHING GINUWINE CAN DO. IF YOU DONT HAVE THE CD GO BUY IT. IF U WANNA ROCK YOUR GIRLS MIND, BODY, AND SOUL PUT THIS CD IN THE DISC PLAYER AND I GUARANTEE U THAT IF YOU AND YOUR GIRL MAKE IT TO TRACK 10-----ONE OF YALL CREEPIN. THE CD IS VERY GOOD AND WORTH EVERY PENNY SPENT; WE'RE AT TRACK 7 AND ITS TIME FOR ME TO GO HANDLE MY BUISNESS---PEACE!!!!
NEGATIVE	Cans are always getting stuck and the handle is always falling down in the way.I would return them if I wasn't so lazy...
POSITIVE	This is story about love. It's a great first novel from a previously published poet. This is a magically woven tale, told in two voices, of two women, one an adult, one an eleven year old, and how they find their lives drastically changed when they meet. To use a baseball metaphor, they both step up to the plate.
POSITIVE	Clare was really too good to be true; putting up with ol' Roger that long after repeatedly catching him with his extramarital affairs? At first I was afraid that Sam was going to be a stalker, the way he kept showing up, but was relieved to learn he wasn't. I liked the way Sarah turned her life around and went after the man she wanted! Poor Maggie----hers and Bob's was such a quick fix! Lot of wasted time, huh Maggie? ha ha This was a good, quick read. Typical Robyn, but good.
NEGATIVE	This video is not worth buying. We have bought a lot of videos, and the So Smart series is the worst we have seen. A typical scene would be a big cartoon face with eyes that blink every few seconds. Our son loves videos, but walks away from this one every time. It is slow, unimaginative, low-quality, and not educational. Try instead the Baby Einstein series or Brainy Baby.
NEGATIVE	Please avoid this film at all costs! Even a second-rate touring company would be a better bet for experiencing this classic musical. Having nary a clue about the larger themes of this drama, director Attenborough thoroughly pummelled this show into a dreadful, hammy production.
NEGATIVE	I placed my order on August 25th, it is now one month later and I have not yet received it. This is unacceptable. I do not encourage anyone to use this vendor. I have received no communication from them or Amazon other than a gleeful little message back in August to say the product had shipped. Right.
NEGATIVE	This thing is absolutely horrible... makes a ton of noise, wastes litter, scares the cats and squishes all their poop on the back wall. I'm sticking with the good old fashioned pooper scooper from now on.
POSITIVE	Very good quality, only con is that the rubber is a bit sticky. It will grab animal hair from the carpet and paint off the wall.
NEGATIVE	The CD's did not work properly as they skipped and wouldn't let me enjoy the show properly. To the credit of the manufacterer who I ordered from, they gave me an immediate refund.
POSITIVE	Perfect balance of information, accessibility, and approachability. It's not a ponderous tome, so kids arent intimidated by it. There are lots of color pictures and examples. The definitions do not cover ALL forms of the word, but so far everything my son has looked up was exactly the definition he was looking for. He sometimes just sits and reads this dictionary!
POSITIVE	This book is my number 1 resource. It is written very well, and the way it is all laid out really works for me. I own several Tarot books, but whenever I need help with a definition this is the one book I always end up turning to, it is very dependable. I also find the section in the back on card combinations (like runs of numbers, suits, ect.) very helpful. I would highly recommend this book to anyone learning the Tarot.
POSITIVE	Instructor speaks in PLAIN ENGLISH about how to approach and handle law school exams. Very helpful especially during that stressful first year!
NEGATIVE	It's amazing how some people gave this movie 5 stars. I could only watch it for 10 minutes - that's how bad it is. I wish I could give it 0 stars. Sharon Stone is the queen of all bad actresses. And can she shut up already about her high IQ and how smart she is. Smart women don't spread their legs in a major motion picture.
NEGATIVE	A good introduction as long as the reader relies on the prose sections, and not the illustations or the study questions. Shows evidence of hasty and slipshod editing. My CCNA exam contained a large number of questions on topics not covered by this book.
NEGATIVE	"From Publishers Weekly:"" ... This volume ... is correspondingly best understood as advocacy reportage, eschewing critical analysis ...""The apparent inability on the authors' part to do any serious fact checking is almost jaw-dropping."
NEGATIVE	"Though I love both the music and the performance on this disk, I hate the fact that I can't put the music on my iPod or listen to it on my computer. (Neither my mac nor my PCs can read the disks.) These misguided copy protection schemes (and the ""dual disk"" format is just that, a disguised copy-protection scheme) don't help anybody. It's easy enough to create a digital copy of the music using an SPDIF output from a high-end CD player, so it will not take long for pirated copies of the music to hit the net, but those of us who are happy to pay for the music, who actually want to be honest, are stuck with choosing between a high-fidelity version that won't work on the iPod, or the low-sound-quality version that Apple provides. (Either that, or pay for the music twice.) I feel as if I'm being punished for being honest."
POSITIVE	"My 16mo old daughter & I looove the shoes (she loves shoes). Another reviewer said the shoe size ran small, I found they were perfect! Actually a little bigger than I expected. I think the quality is great, and there are no ""Sharp"" pieces inside that another reviewer implied. I would recommend these shoes to other moms. They are very unique & we love that in our shoes. Thank you for a simple transaction!"
POSITIVE	A thoroughly enjoyable book with lots of action and plot twists. The characters vary considerably. I find Bek and Quentin unbelievably tedious and identical to the bland characters in other books. The parts focusing on them were rather dull. However others such as Walker, Truls and the Rovers more than made up for this and I would definately recomend the book.
NEGATIVE	Fight Club has all the right messages, but it delivers it in all the wrong ways. This movie is meant to be a social satire, supposed to make us think about our society. What we own owns us, not the other way around. Corporate America controls our lives. These are true messages, ones that I couldn't agree more with. The problem is, you can't degrade corporate America when you ARE corporate America. The great message in this film loses it's genuity when the movie is so hypocritical. 21st Century Fox produced this movie to make money, which is everything that this movie opposed. Open your eyes people. This movie is a fraud.
POSITIVE	So far this Palm z22 has been really easy to use. I was worried about finding a Palm that was user friendly for non-techie people! This is it! The z22 has been very easy to use and will hopefully help me to organize things better!
NEGATIVE	"This is an ok book, but the description given led me to believe that it covered advanced solving techniques. It doesn't. Also the practice puzzles are small and difficult to work within. Also, there is no level of difficulty given for the puzzles. A much better book is Carol Voderman's ""Master Sudoku."""
NEGATIVE	My cats loved this. Unfortunately, I don't know if I got a faulty model, but after 2 months it just died. I always noticed the plug was really hot, but I hoped that was normal. One morning I woke up and the fountain was no longer working.
NEGATIVE	What a waste of money. Never would reccommend this grill to anyone. Food is dry tasteless, and burnt. Maybe the one with the temperature controls are better. But wouldn't reccommend the one without the control. I always have to unplug it to cool off so that my food does not burn while cooking.
POSITIVE	Great book. My Employee Assistance Counselor at work suggested it when my dad died a few months ago. I found it very helpful to read that I am not crazy and that the things I'm feeling and thinking are normal. It covers a variety of scenarios, which I might need in the future when my other parent dies. You don't have to read the whole thing like a textbook. Find the parts that are relevant and it really helps.
POSITIVE	I have many of these courses and love them all. Easy and fun way to learn. Unfortunately, their REBATES are handled by a NOVA CORPORATION: I'm waiting for more information to determine if it's a FRAUD
POSITIVE	"This book really IS telling us the true reason why we overeat. I highly recommend this to any person especially someone who knows Christ and still struggles with obesity and over eating. If you are not a Christian this book will truly lead you to the Truth. It will NOT give you a list of foods to eat. It will give you something better to ""feast"" on. The testimonies are wonderful too."
NEGATIVE	HEY, I LOVE DA BOYS OF LIMP BIZKIT! FRED IS SO HOT! AND WES IS SOOO TALENTED. NOOKIE IS THE BEST SONG CREATED, AND METHOD MAN IS DA MAN! I LOVE LIMP, THEY R BETTER THAT RAGE, KORN OR KID ROCK! THEY R THE BESTEST BAND OF ALL TIME!P.S. justing giving a shoutout to all the knuckleheads who like this kinda rap-metal trash
POSITIVE	Marguerite Henry's King Of The Wind receives newfound embellishment in a deluxe reprint edition illustrated by Wesley Dennis and worthy of gift-giving. The black and white drawings lend character and intimacy to this ever-moving horse story.
NEGATIVE	The story about bullying is very simple. It doesn't provide enough information for a kid to understand why he has been bullied. It should explain about the bully. Why some kids enjoy hurting others physically and emotionaly. This info will help the victim to feel better. Most of the bully are not loved at home and they let the frustration out at school.
NEGATIVE	"This picture frame does not work. It freezes randomly. I sent mine back twice and received the same ""pos"". Do not buy. You will be sorry."
POSITIVE	Third Watch is the first program that my pilot husband could hardly wait till the next episode. After watching a 2003 re-run episode, we cued TIVO to record all episodes and found ourselves watching five times a week till we got caught up with 2004 new season! The NYFD's challenges, the NYPD's decision-making and the EMT's caring will take your mind off your own stresses in life! Third Watch is an excellent action-packed must-see show. Now if we could just get it in DVD!!
NEGATIVE	not particularly technical or inspired metal from the Judas Priest imitator Primal Fear. No heart, soul, or decent lyrics. Certainly no blistering Gamma Rayish guitars or drums. Overall sound quality is good. Slightly better than the first album, but really, neither is worth buying
NEGATIVE	I do, and while I'm not sure if the label indicates that this is not a product for your face and scalp... it should! It felt great going on and for a few hours. But by late morning and for the whole rest of the day I felt like I was covered in grease. You know that feeling you get after eating really greasy fried food? That's the one! It was hard to even wash off. Instead of this I highly recommend the Dessert Essence Jojoba Oil instead (ASIN:B0000C0XL8). You only need a tiny little bit and it works wonders just after shaving my head and face.
POSITIVE	I just bought this for my mom for Mother's day. I don't even like Keith Urban or country. But, I know she enjoyed it.
POSITIVE	This is an excellent text for anyone who wants to learn about investing. Strongly recommended!
NEGATIVE	This is the second time I have been asked to review this purchase/product. The coffee maker arrived on time (Dec. 13th), and was in perfect condition. I am happy with the service.
NEGATIVE	When I started watching this movie I was struck by the number of people who had beautiful blue eyes and then I realized it wasn't real. There really aren't that many people with beautiful blue eyes without being colorized. This film won a academy award for black and white cinematography. Oh well, it's been colorized now. It's a shame.
NEGATIVE	This item didn't exactly work as advertised. It wouldn't detect my dog in the plastic dog house or thru a glass window. Not effective for hunting in the woods, might work in a field but then again you could see animals just as well.
POSITIVE	this game spooks my daughter that is 16 years old lol but she loves it so very much and was very happy how well it was taken care of and how fast they got the game to her
NEGATIVE	I got this to connect some LED hardscape lights and at it works good for that but it does not keep correct time, sometimes the lights come on at night sometimes the come on during the day. The timer is off sometimes by 12 hours or more. I would not recommend this product until Intermatic fixes the issue with the timer.
NEGATIVE	The beeping when you dial the phone, check the caller ID, check your messages, etc, are obnoxiously loud. There's a hum in the background, and you can hear a slight echo of your own voice in the receiver when you're talking. I'm in the process of exchanging the phone.
POSITIVE	"I suggested this DVD to a friend who was very appreciative and had the following comments: ""This is a very helpful and unique rehabilitative DVD. The exercises are very easy to follow even without having prior experience with an exercise program. The stretching alleviates pain and allows for greater flexibility. An added benefit is that the combination of the narrarator's soothing voice, along with the stretching greatly reduces anxiety."""
POSITIVE	My boys love to listen to these stories. I grew up on a farm and you can tell these are real life experiences.
NEGATIVE	I am a long time user of pinnacle reels. They have been my favorite brand until now. I needed a cheaper reel due to finances of late. I got this one. Made very poorly. Plastic reel spool and drag nut do not impress me. The reel makes a light grinding noise when reeling line. The drag is constantly loosening on its own. The nut holding the reel handle also comes loose constantly. I would return it to the manufacturer but I do not want a replacement for this poorly made reel.
POSITIVE	The lead characters do an amazing job at portraying two confused individuals. As they go through life, they impact others in so many strange ways. This movie is captivating and keeps you guessing throughout the whole thing. It leaves you questioning odd behaviors in others.
POSITIVE	this book came in a timely and ordely fashion, it is in great condition almost brand new and it is a great book. i will definetely keep the book for use in future college classes and hopefully will do exceptionally well in this Journalism class. Thanks
NEGATIVE	For those of you who rated this one highly, here's one of ....We have a bent lawyer who unknowingly has 2 CIA agents posing in his office. There are a multitude of hidden cameras filming the lawyer day and night and yet when he goes to the prison the CIA only put a mic in his briefcase which ... is supposed to be as big as a golf ball in this day and age. All the time reading it I was thinking, why haven't they wired him all over? A team of crack CIA operatives are watching this pathetic drunk and yet he eludes him - but still ... for some unfathomable reason. while the real 'crooks' somehow don't get knocked off by the CIA and in the bargain get 2 million dollars each. It's bloody rubbish!!! And childish. In fact, the plot would insult a 12 year old.No star. Dreadful!!
NEGATIVE	I didn't find enough evidence to convince me of the claims in this book. I especially wanted more information about the medical condition of the man while he was in the car. Devout Christians may not have a problem with it. The man was certainly courageous, tho. I admire him for that.
POSITIVE	I was amazed at the outrageous prices for a simple doll cradle, thankfully, I found these. They are adorable, functional, colorful, sturdy and fun. My 3-year-old granddaughter loves them. I wish the dressing table was a little taller, but other than that they're perfect. This is the first product from the Rose Petal Cottage accessory line that I've purchased. If she had the room I'd have bought the cottage and ALL of the accessories I'm that pleased with the quality and the price.
POSITIVE	"I liked this video much better than the upper body workout video. This one has a good mix of men: a very handsome 70s-style gay clone complete with mustache, one college type, a tall black muscle man, an ethnic-looking Italian guy, and an young uncut Eastern European. All of them are naked throughout the whole video. This is softcore erotica not porn, so don't expect any sex or ""excitement"". It's just good-looking naked men exercising.In the upper body video, one model did all the ab exercises, then another did all the shoulder exercises, etc. This video follows a better scheme, as each segment features all the different models. If you don't fancy a particular guy, just wait a minute and you'll see someone else repeating that exercise or a variant. I even got some good workout tips from this video, including several very effective glute builders that can be done anywhere."
NEGATIVE	this is a real piece of overpriced junk that started malfunctioning less than two weeks after I received it.Bad quality audio-just junk.
POSITIVE	I hate to exercise but like Winsor Pilates because it tones my body in just 20 minutes per day. Previously owned this workout series in a VCR tape. Decided to upgrade to DVD. I bought used and was plesantly pleased that the DVDs were in good condition.
POSITIVE	Although I ordered this as a gift, I have been informed it was very enjoyable and arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner
POSITIVE	A pretty good toaster that works as advertised. Once in a while it toasts unevenly, but not sure if that due to the type or shape of the stuff being toasted. Having the same lever load the toast and also extend it for removal is really handy. All in all, a good purchase.
POSITIVE	This is a rugged ceiling plate for the money. The only negative is the rubber grommet that fits in the cable feed hole. It does not fit properly and cannot really be used.
NEGATIVE	I really love Lonesome Dove. This particular movie was not a very good movie. I would not purchase it again.
NEGATIVE	"All I have to say about Christianity is this: it's as fake as pro-wrestling. The best way to get people to adhere to a made-up religion is to say, ""Believe in our lord and you shall live in paradise. Reject him, and you will spend eternity in an unquenchable fire."" I'm sorry if the above statement doesn't pertain to Josh McDowell's book. The book can be summed up as a very simple-minded argument that will reinforce atheists' view that Christians are narrow-minded schmucks."
NEGATIVE	"After inserting this DVD in the DVD player, I got a (pretty long) advertisement for some movie... and then another one... and then another one...I tried to get to the main menu, but the DVD won't allow it, if you want to see this movie, then you HAVE to go through who knows how many ""previews"" of other movies. You cannot fast forward, or skip them.Is the movie ""Dos tipos de cuidado"" really in this DVD? I don't know, I did not have the patience to wait and find out. After an incredible long time of going through movie previews, I took the DVD and trashed it.Avoid this DVD, it is just a collection of movie previews, and you are FORCED to watch them if you (unlike me) have the patience to wait until the movie that you paid to watch actually shows."
NEGATIVE	I received my Blue Planet DVD set in a timely fashion. I received them in the package new and they were in mint condition. I was excited and popped them in my DVD player. Bad News... they're messed up. The DVDs skip around and worse yet, three of them don't read at all. I tried them in two different DVD players and they still don't read. I'm sure this is not the sellers doing, rather, the manufacturers problem. My problem with the seller is that I have sent two emails to them and still, no response. This is terrible service and a terrible product. I;m frustrated. BUYER BEWARE!
POSITIVE	If you are a fan of Daniel Band, then you'll like this. TRB is Toni Rossi who is the guitar player and one of the vocalists for Daniel Band. The music on this album is heavy rock like Daniel Band's music and sounds like Daniel Band since Rossi was one of the main contributors to Daniel Band along with Dan McCabe. Highly recommended.
POSITIVE	Maybe more somewhere between 3 and 4 *I love these BGO packages,and snapped up this one on sight when I saw it in a shop.Had never heard of these guys before.Members have been involved with Rory Gallagher's Taste,Hardin & York,Family and Spencer Davis group.Having not heard any of those bands I am not sure if Axis Point is close to any of the ones mentioned.Sorry.The records were originally released in 1978 and 1980.If you like blues rock on the lighter side, this is a great little package.It is a little much playing this disc from beginning to end.Therefore it usually goes in my 5 disc spinner on random mix and it makes for great variety.
NEGATIVE	the cookbook is great. i bought it for my daughter but the book was very dirty. some of the receipes had a lot of food on it. i sent the book back. will buy another from someone else.
NEGATIVE	This cable does not fit the Coolpix 800, as advertised. Buy at your own risk.
NEGATIVE	After watching Croaching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I was told that this movie would be liken to that and richer, but I can not get past the first scenes. The molestation and deconstruction of the childredn left me feeling dirty. I would not advise anyone to see this movie.
POSITIVE	I purchased this for my elderly mother who fell out of bed. It works well,the only thing is you only get one so you have to order two,one for each side of the bed.If your bed is against the wall on one side you will be okay ordering just one. My Mom cannot pull the bed out away from the wall to make her bed so we needed two. It was easy to install and it also makes it nice when she gets out of bed to grip the top rail to help pull herself up. I would recommend this product.
NEGATIVE	I had to use this book for a class at National University. What a coincidence it was written by a professor at NU! ... The book is biased and doesn't go in depth into anything. Most of us in my class figured we had to buy this book to line Ryan's pockets, none of us really cared for it much...
NEGATIVE	Bought it as an after-thought with another sexy DVD, which I liked very much. Good actors on this one, so expected better. After seeing it, I told my husband to just drop it in the garbage, he suggested we give it to a friend who will watch anything. Except for a couple funny lines, I thought it was a total waste of my time. Mary
POSITIVE	Danielle Steele writes another diversionary read with a fun happy ever after ending! I love this kind of book for a quick mental getaway. Read it in one sitting and think of it as the perfect style writing for women who just need a quick fun pick up. Entertaining and fun to read.
POSITIVE	"My 2 year old daughter loves this book, and so do I. The drawings are incredible (more so when you read that they are completely in water color), the text is beautiful and worth reading again and again(even though we often just marvel at the pictures and don't read all the text at my daughter's age), and what I so appreciate is the highly accurate description of log ecology,that is done so at a level exciting and accessible to a child.If you aren't well-versed in the ecology of rotting logs, this will be a great resource for you as a parent, as well, prior to ""field trips"" to the woods!"
POSITIVE	"I was introduced to this book I'm sad to say by a movie based on it (""The Sea Wolves""). I much preferred the book as usual when comparing novels with their movie counterparts."
NEGATIVE	I purchased this item twice, thinking it would be much easier then drops or strips. The first time it worked about 3 weeks, when it stopped working (luckily I still checked with a strip!) and figured I had used it wrong. The second time it never worked at all. Dangerous to trust your fish to. Use the strips or the drops.
NEGATIVE	Never received item. Owner said it was sent through media mail which takes longer. Wanted this for an xmas gift ordered on Dec. 15th and still never received it as of today 1/15/12. Owner issued refund. I'm very upset that it was not sent through normal mail, I would have received it in 3 days especially since I paid for the postage. Still have no book!
POSITIVE	I was able to find out that I was pregnant before any of the drugstore test kits claim you can get a positive - well before a missed period. Sensitive and reliable.
POSITIVE	I researched this vacuum for several months and decided it was worth trying. It is GREAT! I decided to use the old vac and broom first and then the new vac. I was shocked at the amount we still vac'd with the new one. It truly does a fantastic job. Yes, it is heavy, and yes, you have to learn the hard way to empty the container, but I love this vaccum.
POSITIVE	This book is very helpful in so many ways. It answers things you are not sure of or what to do next when crocheting as different pattern stitches, increases and decreases, etc. It makes crocheting easier and fun when you understand what you are doing and how to do a project.
POSITIVE	If your into Anime or even not really into Anime you will love this series. This anime cartoon series is filled with action, drama, and mystery. I would not recommend it for anyone under the age of 13.
NEGATIVE	Phone died after two days of operation. Handset would not connect with base. Also, handsets get VERY HOT after being on the charger for a few hours. Returned.
NEGATIVE	Ask yourself the question: Why did Martin Gardner write this book?-and also-Ask yourself the other question: Why was The URantia Book put in print?Once you correlate those two answers for yourself, you will understand which is closer to the truth.On a personal level, I still marvel that Gardner could *debunk* the entire URantia Book even though he has not read it in its entirety.He must be truly blessed because with the turn of a few phrases, he can singlehandedly discredit something that took 20 years and hundreds of personalities to put into print.It has taken me over 25 years, not just to read, but to begin to UNDERSTAND the contents of The URantia Book.Maybe, just maybe, he MISSED something in his hurry to publicize the personal lives of persons involved with the human level of publication.Maybe, he missed 2097 pages of fascinating reading.
POSITIVE	Excellent Quality and has many many uses besides in a deep fryer.The handle is always cool and the stainless steel basket won't rust.The basked is 7 inches across so it's great for dipping out shrimpand wings. Does well on spaghetti and noodles also.
NEGATIVE	Walsh took the notes that Sayers left for a Wimsey/Vane mystery, and finished it. I'd rather they had simply published the notes. It is quite obvious where Sayers notes ended, and Walsh is simply incapable of writing in anything like Sayers' voice. And she hasn't a clue about the psychology of the Lord and Lady Peter. Walsh may well write decent novels of her own, but I wish she'd kept her hands off Peter and Harriet.
POSITIVE	this book is a must for quilters interested in history. It's a history and quilting lesson all in one! I have seen her half hour shows on T.V. also and it's great to follow along and even make notes for future useSandie Gano
POSITIVE	I have enjoyed Q-space, as I got some more insight about Q's existence and his or their history. However, something prevented me from really enjoying this story - probably lenght of story and too much 'reference' of old events. Of course I love to recall/newly know those events, but it is sometimes stressful for me, unfortunately. Some of the 'next generation' story is worth reading 2 books or watching 2 hours , but I still love to watch one well-organized program. Hope another 2 books make me more comfortable. To note; 4 stars consists of 3 for this book and 1 for expectations for another two.
NEGATIVE	Acorn really missed the boat! These great feature long movies do not have sub-titles. There are over a million hearing impared people in the USA! What is wrong with this picture!!!! PLEASE re-release all the Poirot Movies with sub-titles!!!!!!!
NEGATIVE	"Scream 4, directed by Wes Craven, stars the original cast mates Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette is a horror movie, or shall I say a ""good"" horror movie. Surprisingly, ""king of scary"" director Wes Craven, does a mediocre job revamping the final sequel. It plays on the original Scream, and pretty has the same story line, just a tad bit more gruesome. The movie starts of with a series of movies with a movie. Scream 4, plays on the whole android/ iPhone bit, using an ""app"" to prank call people using the scream voice. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) returns back to Woodsbro to finish promoting her book. Coincidently it's the 10th anniversary of Woodsbro slaughter. The killer is threatening to kill everyone close to her, especially her cousin Jill (Emma Roberts). I wonder who the killer is now....?"
NEGATIVE	It whitened my teeth a little but not to the extent advertised. And it was very messy! You have to leave the trays on for an hour, so if you want to do it make sure you have no one you need to talk to and that the phones are off the hook. Its very inconvient and it sortof irritated my gums. Also its very foamy, so like I said, messy. Goodluck
POSITIVE	I bought this for my yearly home trip cross pacific ocean.Unlike those pricey noise-cancelling earphone, this just reduce the outside noise by blocking.It's a much better choice for audiophile on plane since you don't have to suffer from the audio distortion from noise-cancelling.All you need is a nice in-ear phone and put the muff on.You can enjoy the music with least distortion and distraction.Also you don't have to boost the volume up, so you are actually protecting you ear which noise-cancelling cannot do the same.Most importantly, it cut off those unpleasant noise as well.In my west-coast to east coast flight, it save me from screaming baby and impatient mother.Thanks for this muff, I'm the only one can still be myself in the whole plane~~It's a little bit hot after wearing them for hours, but it's nothing compare to the tranquil it brings you all the way.
POSITIVE	I like the book because of the principles behind it, you might not be relating to the one you love in the right way and it opens your eyes to explore other avenues of expressing and receiving love.
NEGATIVE	Titanic is the highest grossing movie of all-time and it was pointless! A 3rd class guy saves a 1st class young woman and they fall in love.
NEGATIVE	Worst label printer EVER! I bought it for my busiess to label file folders and it is TERRIBLE. It is designed to waste an INCREDIBLE amount of label tape. It is very difficult to get the output you want...again the primary design is to waste tape. Don't buy it!
NEGATIVE	That was the stupidest movie I have EVER seen in my ENTIRE life! I'm actually dumber for having watched it. In fact, I think my wife's womb is now barren having stayed awake through that debacle of a movie. I may sue!
POSITIVE	This is a really fun book to read, a great book to take to the beach. It has some tearful moments too. But the characters are real, the situation has just enough fantasy and the humor will make you laugh out loud. I have but one complaint about this book. It takes place in Queens--the home of the Mets-- but the main characters are lifelong Yankee fans!
POSITIVE	I read this in less than 24 hours - started at 8 PM one night, and finished at noon the next day (and did get some sleep, bathe some kids, do some grocery shopping,etc. in between!) SO...it's not a taxing read (great literature) by any means, but I'm embarrassed by how much I enjoyed it. Unlike others, I do find the chemistry totally believeable between the main characters - and I liked the story very much. I'm a mystery lover, so I will admit the mystery is a bit weak - however the rest of the story is a terrific read.
POSITIVE	This is a highly readable book, and jam-packed with information and insights into Breton, as a poet, and as a man, who knew what he wanted, and what he imagined. This was a powerful collaboration between a poet and a painter, between Breton and Miro. Touching on magic, on the force and importance of analogy, on the struggles of surrealism during the years when it was considered to have passed on (proving to the contrary) and, in essence a very intriguing history of the spirit of surrealist exploration. Very much against the other review here, this is an important, and very powerful book. Highly recommended!
POSITIVE	This book gave us the insite that we needed. It was the first book that we read, and gave us the knowledge to get started. It a must for someone needing the basic knowledge of the craft.
POSITIVE	This movie again gave Holmes' fans a good chance to explore the adventures of this most famous detective. However, there are too many slow-motion-scenes that destroy the pace and bore the audience.
POSITIVE	This is a great introduction to learning spanish. I found it very useful. Learning any language is hard but this guide makes it painless. Okay, it's not Rosetta Stone (that's a tough act to follow) but Open Door to Spanish is still a great tool for learning.
NEGATIVE	Like so many other reviewers on on this product, this dryer suddenly stopped working for me also. I was satisfied with this hair dryer for the 6 weeks or so that I actually got to use it. It has a lot more power than your average hairdryer and does seems to cut down on drying time. It is a little heavier than my previous hairdryer but that didn't bother me. I really liked the extra long cord. BUT, this hairdryer completely stopped working on May 19... I purchased it on March 28. I tried it on every plug in my bedroom and it still wouldn't work... other appliances worked as normal in the outlets. There is a 30-day return policy, so this was basically a waste of $50.00 for me. If you still feel compelled to try this dryer, buy it from a seller with a better return policy.
NEGATIVE	This is the first garlic press that I have ever had. The one thing that is inescapable is that it takes a lot of hand strength to use it. This fact is the overriding reason for my three-star rating. Admittedly, my hands are fairly arthritic, but it still takes a great deal of force to press the garlic through. For that reason alone, I would not recommend this tool for anyone experiencing ongoing pain in their hands; this press will surely aggravate it. The tool itself is sturdy and well made, although I'm also unimpressed with the cleaner feature; it still needs to be manually cleaned. The press goes through the dishwasher just fine. However, it's pricey to me at almost $15; it should be more like $10.
NEGATIVE	The Camping set turned out to be Micro-Mini. Was surprised it has been classified for kids aged 4+ as I doubt they would have any interest in this Product. Perhaps a magnifying glass would help!
NEGATIVE	Very disappointed in this bamboo spatula. The spatula end is poorly formed. The carving is very uneven on the sides and end. There are very obvious sanding marks in the bowl. If it wasn't such a hassle I'd return it.
NEGATIVE	"I was amazed when I first discovered the missing text/sentences in this edition, but I am halfway through this book and have many many times come across places where it looks like this: ......"" said Vronsky. And the missing text is just not in there to read!This is a five star book but I give a 1 star rating on account of missing text which is unforgivable IMO.I don't understand how this has happened???"
POSITIVE	This weather radio is a fine unit. You have it set and leave it on always, It makes not a sound unless there is a weather alert and it go off 24/7It is comforting to know that in the middle of the night whenever this Unit will make a warning sound thatyou cannot miss.I bought one for my Mom who is 86 and she loves it to.It may scare or startle you some but it is well worth that warning. Once it issues a warning it automatically starts broadcasting the National Weather Radio warning that's going on.Real fair price I felt and a nice safety addition to your home.I and my Mom have no regrets about it. Mom won't turn hers off as I won't it's Super Reliable
POSITIVE	I have had BASEketball in my posession for about 9 months now, and I can honestly say it is my favorite movie. I have watched it at least 150 times, and I made all my buds watch it too. We all love it. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are both brilliant in this film. I loved it so much, I had to get Orgazmo and Cannibal! The Musical too! They are all great movies, and I recommend that you try to see the other two if you liked BASEketball!
NEGATIVE	This book was not up to the reading standards of the Book Bandits teen bookclub in Meridian, Idaho. There was no empathy between readers and the characters, the plot was totally predictable, the characters were not developed fully, and the entire story did not capture the attention of the readers. The cover art wasn't very compelling either. The group suggests that you read Sherlock Holmes and Nancy Drew stories as a mystery alternative.
POSITIVE	I ordered this book because i have three kids, ages 6, 9 and 12. Homework, piano lessons, soccer, play dates, and two working parents left us breathless and our house never clean. I used this book to set up charts for every day of the week with chores and events for me and my kids. For a month now, we check the charts every day as soon as we come home from school, and all the homework and chores and practices get done!! It's amazing. I am NOT an organized person, and this book helped me to get it together. I still have a lot to do, but now I know it's getting done. The reason I didn't give it five stars: it's a bit outdated. There are lots of online resources now that weren't available when it was published. A new edition is necessary for those of us who rely on the web.
NEGATIVE	I bought this movie and was checking it out on amazon before I watched it and am I ever glad I did before I opened it up for $19.00. After reading the reviews I don't even want to watch it for $9.00. Maybe after it gets down to $0.99 I will be willing. Thanks to everyone for writting about it so I could sped my money on a good film. THANK YOU
POSITIVE	Got this in the mail and to be honest, I was a little intimidated to thread the thing. I took it out of the box and read the directions and had it threaded in no time at all! Sews nicely, too!
POSITIVE	Great movie ... its about consequesces to your decisions... good and bad.. forgiving and moving on ... seeking truth and wanting to know answers no matter how painful they might be... I love this movie and was happy to enjoy it with my family!!
NEGATIVE	I was skeptical but had read a few good reviews for this product. It lasted less than an hour with our mastiff. This was also one of the few balls that he's been able to obliterate so quickly.
NEGATIVE	"Sugar Ray was good at one time. RPM was an enjoyable little diddy, but as soon as they found out they'd make more money with that poppy acoustic rock, they got on their knees to make the audiences happy. Although the CD is okay, it's too poppy for me. The best treat is by far the song ""Stay On"" with Nick Hexum, frontman of the band 311. Many people fail to realize Hexum's vocals on this though, therefore it will be skipped. Overall, this should appeal to all the bubblegum pop fans, as well as the blink 182 teenyboppers out there.Music fans can pass on this one though, you've heard it before."
POSITIVE	If you heard this on the radio, you could mistake this recording for a lost Cannonball Adderley session. Vincent Herring has clearly studied Cannonball, and he has the great intonation and tone of the Master. Louis Hayes was Cannonball's drummer for classic sessions, and he is still burning it up. Jeremy Pelt is an excellent stand-in for Nat Adderley. My only hesitation, and the reason for 4 rather than 5 stars, is that to my ears the pianists here are not as facile with the tunes as the other performers. If you long for a new Cannonball recording, you will be happy with this one.
NEGATIVE	Almost purchased this item until I realized that I was going to pay twice as much in shipping and handling as I would for the mug boss. The Mug Boss is cute but that isn't funny.
NEGATIVE	Jailene mesmerised me they day I saw here on the cover of the CD. I bought it in early 98 in London. I haven't opened it yet. She still looks as great as she looked on the first day. I will keep it wrapped under the celophane cover forever! Incidentally, does anybody knows how I can get in contact with her?Jailene me hipnotizo el dia que la vi en la tapa de su CD. Lo compre a principios de 98 y aun no lo he abierto. Todavia luce tan resplandeciente como el primer dia que la vi. La guardare cubierta en el celofan brillante que la rodea. A proposito. Alguien sabe como contactarme con ella?Pablo ricotipo@hotmail.com
NEGATIVE	A total waste of possible talent, this CD is just awful on so many levels. Wes is off-key in many of the songs, and his voice is unconvincing and irregular. In theory this album is a good idea, but the execution is so painful. I've really tried to get into this CD, but in the end, I taped it to the ceiling in my office, so nobody has to listen to it.
POSITIVE	If you are familiar with the characters Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb, there is really no mystery here. But, as they say, it's not the destination that is important, but the journey itself. Connelly's writing is fast paced and streamlined. We are not given large doses of non-essential information just to prolong the story, as happens with quite a few other authors these days. We learn a little more about Harry but he remains a mystery, and that is the hook. A journey well worth the effort.
NEGATIVE	The series of psx disappointments continues. FF 7 was fun but not really a Final Fantasy game, FF 8 was fun enough to finish (intresting how the limit break system was just a less random one of final fantasy 3/6's) and now 9, well 9 was the first final fantasy game that I will not be finishing. It's sad, but the story is neither gripping nor exciting. The creators tried to recapture the greatnest of FF 6 but failed miserably, the humor is well [bad]. The dialogue is one of the few average parts, and the graphics were just a FF7 and FF8 mix.
POSITIVE	Just purchased this kitchen yesterday for my daughter's 6th birthday. She absolutely loves it!! I had no problems putting the kitchen together, in fact, as a previous buyer of too many Little Tikes to recall, it had to rank as one of the easiest in terms of assembly. Price was a little more than I wanted to spend but I am happy with the overall quality of the kitchen. My only issue was with the interactive laundry component. It did not work. I called Little Tikes and after about a 10-minute wait to talk to an operator everything was resolved.This may very well be the last Little Tikes product I buy for my children (due to age, not complaints) and I would recommend it highly.
POSITIVE	I'm a dental student studying gross anatomy. Usually, students don't have enough skill in disecting the cavador to all stuctures (arteries, muscles, vein, nerves) they've studied. This reference help me improving and completing my lab skill. Its pictures are all color. They're all real picture. All structure are all clear. (clean fascia very clearly) Some sturctures are dyed so they help you identify and understand it easier.It's the best lab reference book I've ever had.
NEGATIVE	"NIGHT OF THE DEMONS is absolute trash. Nearly devoid of plot with acting on par with the latest infomercial, this movie drags horribly and is simply a flesh festival. It is one of those films, which you would like your time back from. It is a useless piece of cinema meant only for exploitative purposes. Cheesy to the extreme, 90's CGI, absurd script, pointless drivel. DEMONS was a ""there is nothing else out to rent this week"" rental. Don't waste your time, money, or effort to seek this out for any reason. It has no redeeming qualities at all. Trash, trash, trash. NOT FOR KIDS! NO STARS.....I only gave it one because Amazon does not allow a ""No"" stars rating."
NEGATIVE	Just not a very good album. Rather than creating new music that lives and breathes (like the Squirrel Nut Zippers), CPD just photocopy a style they like.
NEGATIVE	"We loved this vacuum from the day it arrived until the day it broke. The cleaning head is held onto the arm by a tiny plastic C-clamp which locks into place with even tinier plastic pins. A few months of very gentle use and those pins came off. Electrolux has now agreed to send us a replacement clamp, but the service person on the phone made clear she would send just one and that this was a ""courtesy"". What about 4 months from now when the new one breaks? This is clearly a design flaw, and the manufacturer should include 5 or 10 of these things for the vacuum to still work a few years after purchase."
NEGATIVE	This album could never ever ever be a five star. just download their good songs and make your own best of.
POSITIVE	I have to write that this album is the most beautiful from all albums of Pablo. Pablo sings more profeionally. His voice in the song Olvidarte jamás is very preciosa. The best songs are: olvidarte jamás, toda ley, gallo de pelea, se te olvido, vas a entender, como tenerte otra vez... Muchas gracias Pablito
POSITIVE	I love this rug. Was concerned as it seemed to be shedding, but the manufacturer assured me most rugs made this way do shed and should stop soon. Blends well with my new daybed cover and the colors in the room.
POSITIVE	This is music and an artist you wont find just anywhere. Gavin DeGraw's album Chariot and Chariot Stripped changed my life. He can sing a song and make you believe every word of it. This has everything you could want in music. Good words, good vocals, good music. Very close to perfect. Trust me Gavin DeGraw is a legend in the making. My favorite on this album is Change is Gonna Come. He does a tremendous encore of the original by Sam Cooke. When I first heard this, I was in the car and almost wrecked because my whole body just went in chills. If you want good music, this is where its at.
NEGATIVE	"The commercials for the Spectrcolor make it look like a light up ""magnadoodle"". It is not easy to make a distinct picture on this toy! My 2 and 4 year olds received this for XMas. The 4 year old became very frustrated that he couldn't make a distinct picture. My husband and I had a hard time of it. It is even dfficult to make the screen all 1 color. The 2 year old liked to run his hands over it to watch the colors change, but running his hands over the pointed lights made his fingers raw. Don't waste your money! Buy a LightBrite!"
POSITIVE	I was please with the movie and the speed of the delivery of it as well. Especially to re watch it again at home I felt like I was watching it again at the Theater the quality was great. I highly recommed when buying you think about using this source to buy from Thanks
POSITIVE	"I recently developed tinnitus and couldn't sleep as the noise in my ear was intermittent and driving me crazy. I looked at expensive sound machines but was wary of being able to sleep with the sounds they had to offer. This machine is great! It sounds like wind rushing though, sort of like a vaporizer running. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because there wasn't that much difference in the sound when I moved the dial which opens and closes the air holes. It's definitely ""white noise"" and I would definitely recommend this product."
NEGATIVE	Buyer beware: I'm certain this is not olive oil. It is DEFINITELY NOT Extra Virgin Olive Oil. It has NO smell or taste of olive oil. I'm trying to get my $ back somehow . . . .
NEGATIVE	I have been a loyal house head for over 15 years and for the first time since Richard has pumped out intense mixes, this is the first time I am dissapointed. It sounds more like electro-pop-rock-digital boring crap. I didnt bob my head or feel like dancing. Is he even trying anymore. If his next album is this bad he will be cutt of from being in my vinyl and cd collection.
POSITIVE	this is more like a 3 and a half stars rating.what brought this movie down for me was the sloppy hong kong wire work.the people who was doing it seemed like they never did it before.it looked so awful it was just corny.wich brought this otherwise decent flick down.the mood and scenematogrphy was good,so was the story.but the attempts at the john woo style action failed in most scenes.some looked good but for the most part they failed horribly with the action.if they had suceeded in the action part this would have been the best strait to video movie i had ever seen.but if they make a sequel they should learn from their mistakes
NEGATIVE	"If you expect a DVD quality , please don't . The sound its not the best either, but you still can hear it , is not been remastered since it was released I believe. The good thing about this movie is in Full screen format. Until a better comes out ( if it does) this is a ""good"" option !!"
POSITIVE	I read this book in three days. I couldn't put it down. While I was working I continued to think about the characters, and tried to decide who done it. I didn't want to read this by myself. I hope Wendy Corsi Staub hurries up and writes another book, I can't wait for the next one.
POSITIVE	We bought this after using the iLube for many years. We're still trying to decide which we like better. This product is definitely SLIPPERY! It starts that way, and stays that way. The bad news is it is harder to wash off than iLube. You do have to use soap and water. It became harder to find iLube and never in any packaging larger than the 1.75 ounce bottle. This Swiss Navy is definitely cheaper in price. I think we're going to like the Swiss Navy brand better. I may edit this review in a few months, however right now the slippery factor is seeming an adequate trade-off over the clean up issue.
NEGATIVE	I just received these and it was a waste of money. They are not adjustable and do not work with high top maternity pants.This would be a great product however, they are Not Adjustable and Belly Ups needs to know that not everybody's torsois the same length and they should be adjustable for any kind of pants you might wear high top or low rise and they arenot. Extremely disappointed :(
POSITIVE	After buying this well-priced little book last year, I have found myself going back to it again and again for fresh inspiration and ideas. The author's simple, sensible approach quickly moves beyond theory to what you can actually do to improve how your home feels.
POSITIVE	"This is a great ""what-if"" tale. It tells the tale of a lowly rat that is transformed into one of Cinderella's coachman. But there is more. This story is very innovative and amusing and you get a rodent's perspective on this classic fairytale episode with a few twists thrown in for good measure."
NEGATIVE	thaks to that other reveiwer who said speling is'nt impotent, capatilism is the gratest sistem ever weather or not we spel it write. but he said second-handers was gonna be the tittle of the fountainhead, he is rong it was gonna be second hand lives.anyway we sure do got to form concepts, i think thats way more impotent then lerning to spel write. capatilism is teriffic and if you do'nt like this book you are a SECOND HANDED.
NEGATIVE	"In this comical book, Sin The claims to be able to ""sense"" who calls him on the phone before picking it up. He obviously could not ""sense"" that Americans are not complete fools and would NOT believe this hog-wash. I suppose next he will claim to be able to shoot lightning bolts from his eyes?"
POSITIVE	this book came at a reasonable time. i can't comment on the contents of the book seeing as it was for me. But the person I bought for was very happy with the book condition and its new looking cover..even if the book itself was used.
POSITIVE	Great tones and sound overall.Very impressed as 1st time buyer & user.Easy to use and perfect accessory to have.
POSITIVE	I have always had outdoor gas grills. Recently I moved to a condo where outdoor grills are not allowed and it became a quest to find the ideal indoor grill. I had seen a DeLonghi grill at a gourmet kitchen supplies store for a cost of $99. I proceeded to research the grills on the internet and found that the DeLonghi BG16 had great reviews. I ordered it at a cheaper price from Amazon and I am very happy with it. It cooks the food evenly and quicky and it also leaves the grill marks on the food. My husband has also used it and he loves it. It is also super easy to clean. I recommend this grill without hesitation.
NEGATIVE	This book is not at all like the original body for life. The author took Bill Phillip's simple eating plan (one portion protein, one portion carbs, and veggies at at least two meals) and made it complicated. She cut out some carbs based on activity level and limited the types of carbs and veggies you eat. If you have time to sit down every evening and plan out your exericse and meal plans for the next day, then you might benefit from this book. If not, stick with the original.
NEGATIVE	On the surface this book looks very informative. It does give a broad understanding of J2EE.BUT, I found the numerous errors and typos to be very distracting to the point that I had to write this review. I would bet there are typos on almost every page of text. Some are so bad that I could not understand the entire topic. Others were less obvious until I read other sources that contradicted this book. In other words, I thought I knew the topic until someone else corrected me. Very bad!Despite the reviews that maybe correctly portray the overall book, I highly recommend boycotting this publisher for putting out such a poor quality book. I for one will try my best to never buy a Prentice Hall book again.
NEGATIVE	This author does not appear to know the true God. These are personal beliefs written in the form of fiction. There is no scriptural basis, and the story is so against what the bible has said re: Lucifer, it is obvious she has not done any study ofher subject matter. For any reader who has not studied the bible or God, this is true fiction, and should in no way be considered a true representation of God or Satan.
NEGATIVE	It looks cool until you expect to see the light show! The red color shines brightly but the green is dim in color and the blue is invisible. If the lighting were to operating properly, I would be giving it more stars. The light show is the only reason I bought this product...it stinks!
POSITIVE	I first read this book twenty years ago, and I loved it. Since then, my husband and I have built a house in the Baja. God and Mr. Gomez has something of a cult following among those of us who have done so. Incidentally, we all feel Jack Smith had it easy!
POSITIVE	"Even after 30 plus years of recording (at the point of this set being recorded) ""Killer"" still has the licks. While the fact that the original versions of the songs aren't all here (only Great Balls Of Fire has an orginal version of it) Jerry Lee is still bangin' away at the piano. For him to have been able to record such good re-recordings of these songs is amazing especially when you consider all he has been through (see the movie or read his book if you don't know of what I speak). I declare him the TRUE KING of Rock And Roll because he didn't lose his edge like Elvis did. The only reason I only gave this 4 stars is because I would have liked more originals also. But that's just my opinion and as Dennis Miller has said I could be wrong..."
NEGATIVE	"After reading ""The Isaiah Effect"" I became interested in finding out more about the Bible Code so I read the Bible Code by Michael Drosnin and after some research came to the conclusion that this book is nonsense. Drosnin's claims can be disproved rather easily. Several mathematician's have done so. This book is worthless!"
POSITIVE	"As a teacher of elementary age children, and focusing on performing arts in the afternoons, I must say that ""The Music Man"" is the quintessential musical to use in introducing musical theater to young people. The DVD version provides good sound, a very clear picture, great color, and a wonderful overall movie-watching experience."
NEGATIVE	"I paid over ...bucks for the the 9 disc boxed set and didn't buy it from a store but ordered on line, so I couldn't get the refund I SO deserved. Rhino..you should be ashamed of yourself for duking lovers of this classic period in Americana. Some oif the performances are cut, Diana Ross and The Supremes' version of Love is Like An Itching in My Heart was part of a 3 song medley when it originally aired (complete w/classic Supremes choreography) and you butchered the other 2 songs. And that's just the start...Folks don't buy this or any other Sullivan ""shew"" compilation unless all it's the full content of the show. And where is Shirley Bassey?"
POSITIVE	A cracking read... better than the movie of the same name. Ken Follet is addictive, having read most of his books i intend to read the rest.
POSITIVE	this staff is convenient to be used and get a warm temperature fast and quickly. and it seems safe to be used even when sleep. i like it.
NEGATIVE	"I just purchased this unit from walmart today. It does not play ANY disc I put in and I tried 4 standard DVD discs. It simply showed ""no disc"" on the display. It's a lemon! I am returning it tomorrow. I have bought so many electronic equipments. Never has this happened before. This is the 2nd Philips product I have purchased in my life (the other is a 27"" TV). Both had quality issue (the TV's remote died once). I am convinced Philips has the WORST quality control. I'd never buy another philips again."
NEGATIVE	First of all if you think this is better than the original or are unaware that there is even an original then do everyone a favor and stop watching movies...This movie was crap. They totally changed it from the original...for instence the movie starts off as there being no zombies where as in the original this carnage has been happening. Being a re-make and a sequal at that should reflect the orginals and not go for cheap scares. AND SINCE WHEN CAN PEOPLE WHO DIE AND COME BACK TO LIFE RUN! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT! This movie sucks. DONT BUY IT.
POSITIVE	Terrific documentary footage! Makes you feel like you are watching the events today on CNN.
POSITIVE	This is a great CD. Peaceful, calming, mysterious music. Especially good songs are Bamboo Dance and Sea Wind. Very talented musicians.
NEGATIVE	The transaction was smooth but the product was defective as the CD on which the software was loaded had been scratched to the point that it would not load.
NEGATIVE	"Good historial review of calligraphy, but would not recommend it as a good reference book if you are looking for something to guide and show you how to do calligraphy. Recommend ""Encyclopedia of Calligraphy"" instead. I purchased first edition many years ago, and accidentally bought this one again. Oh well..."
NEGATIVE	To start things off with, this album deserves negative stars. After listening to this album countless times, I came to the conclusion that this is the sort of music that I might think that pirates would listen to. The music is brimming with emotional drivel that makes me quite sea sick. It's time for this fatuous foursome of the seven seas to try something new in life like treasure hunting or shoe shining, but not making another appearance to the studio but to produce nothing but balderdash.
POSITIVE	"While out Christmas shopping for his mother, my 5 year old asked if there were any Britney Spears DVDs available. We checked and he asked if he could have this one for Christmas, so I got it. I'm not much into her music but both of my sons love this DVD. The short program is no problem since they tend to have relatively short attention spans and run from one toy to another. One good thing is that this caused them to discover Joan Jett due to Britney's cover of ""I Love Rock and Roll"". The sound and video on this disc is excellent. I don't remember girls looking quite like Britney when I was a teen..."
NEGATIVE	Nine West Shoes usually fit me very well but these boots just didn't look right on my feet. I sent them back.
POSITIVE	Este libro es muy atractivo para los niños de 2 a 5 años ya que con el trabajan las desterzas de identificar grupos de alimentos y el contar del 1 al 10 ademas del tema de la metamorfosis
NEGATIVE	Bill Maher is as annoying as the nut cases he interviews. Trash film at its worst. A waste of time.
NEGATIVE	Good gawd! This episode was simply AWFUL. I really do love this show but the writers have seriously driven this clever show off a steep cliff! Makes me wonder if JJ Abrams was secretly writing the last four episodes since that's when, in my humble opinion, the writing started to painfully suffer and spiral. What happened??! Oh well, EUREKA has indeed finally run its course. I will miss Carter, Allison, Joe, Henry, Fargo and the rest of the gang. Sad to see this show go out on such a poorly written sour note.
NEGATIVE	be extremely carefull when you order this product from amazon. they only sell the pink cover version (the blue cover version is no longer made). somebody dropped the ball on this edition, the pink cover version should be scrapped and re-issue the blue cover version. some songs on the blue edition are missing on the pink edition. also, the songs on the blue edition are much longer. if you see a copy of a blue cover edition, dont hesitate to grab it.(most owners are unwilling to part with it once they have it).
NEGATIVE	"While not quite as bad as the Kent Brockman title quote would make it seem, this CD is nowhere near as durable, nor venerable, as the institution known as ""The Simpsons."" Oddly enough, ""Sing The Blues"" remains their best-selling effort, and features the chart hits, ""Do The Bartman"" and ""Deep, Deep, Trouble."" There would be better to follow, with, and apart from the cast, as ""Go Simpsonic"" and Dan Castellaneta's ""Two Lips"" would later reveal."
NEGATIVE	This book is not like the first. It basically rewords everything leaving a lot still in the dark. As the half blood prince comes out next month when will this be done. Hopefully book 7.Not recomending anyone to buy this.
POSITIVE	I've been using P90X but wanted a different cardio workout. This workout is very fun, and let me tell you, you work up a sweat. For me the hardest part was getting the choreography down, but after doing each workout a couple of times, I knew what to do, and really started enjoying it. The music is fun, Chalene's personality comes off the screen, and I love the fact that when we are working our left side she is working her right side so we are mirroring what she does which I think makes learning the moves so much easier.Once you learn the routines you have the option of turning up the music and not hearing her, but I'm not quite there yet.Anyway, I recommend it. You will need some hand weights for the sculpting workout, depending on your fitness level, anywhere from 1# to 10#.Because I liked Chalene and this workout I actually just ordered her new collection of dvd's called Turbofire, can't wait to receive it.
NEGATIVE	I picked this book up and started reading the CMU camera chapter. The chapter lack depth and completeness. The author says nothing about how the image could be transmitted wirelessly to the PC or how the CMU camera communicates with the PIC. It seems that he is more concerned with selling the camera from his company Images SI than he is with writing a good book. The only useful thing that he mentioned is that you need to activate a software flourescent filter in a room that uses such lighting. But the price definately reflects the quality in this case!
POSITIVE	This was a really fun purchase. My son wore this to a Harry Potter book party in Hudson, Ohio. Everyone kept asking us where we got it. He has since worn it in the house several times. We are planning on using it for Halloween as well.Purchases like this make the books come to life.
POSITIVE	I'm a beginner with woodworking, and I bought the R3 for it's low price for a few projects. It's really easy to use, and after reading through the instruction booklet once, I don't have to look at it again. I've used it to make pocket holes to replace L-brackets in a project and to improve some cheap particle board furniture, and both are now much more sturdy than they were before. Needless to say, I will be using it a lot more, and I'll buy another whenever this one wears out.
POSITIVE	I use these combined with the large Everlasting Treat Ball. My pit mix is occupied with this combination for about an hour to 45 minutes. The German Shepherd is busy for almost 2 hours. There are other vendors on Amazon who sell this item and are worth checking out
POSITIVE	"As a former Microsoft technical lead who was a part of the ""core"" Enterprise server support team I will tell you that this is the one book that is (still) handed out to all new members of our team!Within Microsoft server support this book is the architecture ""bible"".Also David and Mark's elegant shareware tools <http://sysinternals.com> were also the only 3rd party tools that were sanctioned for recommendation to Microsoft customers.This book is the defacto standard for all things relating to Windows architecture. Not always an easy read, but if you are persistent and just keep re-reading (which is what I had to do for a long time!) eventually it will sink in, and when it does you will understand (and appreciate) Windows on a very low level.Highly recommended!Vic Rozumnybtw- MS recently bought sysinternals and you will be redirected when you go to the site. Congrats guys."
NEGATIVE	I'm not a rich man and my need for this information was not pressing, so I waited to purchase this book until the price dropped a little. I managed to get it used, but as far as I'm concerned [money] was still too much to pay given the potential of the subject. I agree with some of the user reviews I've read about editing. Kaplan suffers from Stephen-King-itis, i.e., made a name for himself as a guru and apparently believes he's above editing and each word is golden. I agree with another review about it being a good visual title on the shelf, it's just too bad it lacks specific detail and workable code samples so you can be sure he actually knows what he's talking about. (Yes, he does often know what he's talking about, but if you weren't familiar with his reputation, it wouldn't be proven by this book.)
NEGATIVE	ITS TRU GTA3 FOR GBA HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED. IT WAS DISCONTINUED ABOUT A MONTH AGO. IF ANYONE NEEDS PROOF GOTO IGN.COM LOOK THROGH THEIR PREVIOUS NEWLETTERS IN ONE OF THEM IT WILL SAY THAT THE COMPANY CREATING THE GAME WAS UNABLE TO FIT ALL THE INFO ON SUCH LITTLE MEMORY. SO EVN THO IT WOULD BE GREAT ITS NOT GOIN TO BE MADE AND NEVER WILL BE TIME TO GET OVER IT!
NEGATIVE	How about putting a list up of the songs that are in the cd set. I really like to kind of have that information first before I purchase it.
NEGATIVE	This shaver misses a lot of hairs on each pass, so you must go over each area several times. Even then, the shave is not very close. As a comparison, my Braun travel shaver cuts closer and quicker. The problem may just be the size and shape of the foil holes. Hard to complain too much as I paid only $30, but I wouldn't recommend it. It is adequate as a back up shaver only, perhaps for your gym bag.
NEGATIVE	Bought this skimmer for my Intex inflatable pool. It says it should work for this size pool, but once hooked up there is not enough suction for it to work. Does not suction at all.
NEGATIVE	what a completely boring album by suede. why has this band who once achieved SOMETHING musically produced such a tragic record? it appears they stopped listening to all other bands and decided to listen only to their own records for an influence specifically coming up. gone is the baroch bowie loveyness and we have an album of boring songs with the following key words featured in most of them 1. car parks 2. trainers (shoes) 3. council estate....... its rubbish!!
NEGATIVE	The black cartridges are fine, but the color ones seem to have been made for another printer. Essentially, only 50-percent of my order was filled.
NEGATIVE	I read the Orthe books and couldn't wait to get into another 1110 pages of Mary Gentle's work.I am sure she put an enormous amount of work into it but it seems chiefly to have gone into including as many obscure weaponry words as possible.As another reviewer said, it's juvenile, gratuitous and ill-made - if this book did not have Mary Gentle's name on it, I would not have been able to pick it as from the same author.Ash seems to swear and flail around in armour a lot, but she is not believable at all and certainly not a strong female character like Christie was in the Orthe books.The imagination and imagery is also sadly missing.To be honest, I haven't finished the book and I don't think I will.
NEGATIVE	After charging the Rio 800 and calibrating the battery (an annoying 5 hour process), I spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out how to load songs on to it. This is mainly a fault of the instructions, once you get the hang of it, the software isn't that bad.The product was great for about an hour. Then, it shut down for no apparent reason. Even with the adapter plugged in, it won't power up. Trying to get through on their customer service line is next to impossible. This thing is a complete waste of money.After I returned it, I bought an Intel Pocket Concert. Its a little more expensive and doesn't come with as many accessories, but it has worked every time I've used it and I'm much happier with the purchase.
NEGATIVE	"This phone has terrible reception. I can barely hear the other person on the line, there is a ""Loud"" button to press, but it only increases the loudness of my own voice, and increases the static on the line. I do not recommend!"
POSITIVE	I love this... it is my favorite of all Tasty Bites! I never get tired of it! Great Flavor!
POSITIVE	Tried to use a collar to walk my 3 month Pom Pom, she absolutely refused to be walked... put this harness on and she walks freely after a couple minutes of having it on!Easy on the neck
NEGATIVE	"Since the death of Stephen Ambrose, Penguin has hired Douglas G. Brinkley to 'update' the book. It now contains such nonsense as the ""1980 October Surprise,"" the much investigated and thoroughly discredited claim that Reagan and Khomenei conspired to keep the hostages seized in 1979 captive till after the election.With nonsense like this in it, one can no longer trust anything in the book. Therefore, the 8th edition should not be purchased or used for anything but birdcage liner.With luck, there will be a ninth edition revised by someone sane, but till then, buy and use only editions 1-7."
POSITIVE	This is a great puzzle for the Boston sports fan. It's 550 pieces and works up pretty fast. I think we finished it in 3 days. A nice one to preserve and hang. : )
NEGATIVE	Who made this awful script? It seems they wrote on weekend and having a beer. Who thought about those bad dialogues? And the bad characters trying to make jokes as Mr. Freeze, I don't understand why include Batgirl, and all those colours on the scrren gives you a headache. The fights have no thrill. Have you seen the rails on the ice before the cars of the heroes pass? Yes you can see the rails made to make the movement of the transports easier, while making the movie. Typical of a bad director. If producers wanted to destroy the the heroe, why put villains of Batman instead of the movie producers?Save your money and time with this JUNK.
POSITIVE	"I really truly didn't wish to read this book at first, wondering if i would find it to be both inspiring and entertaining in one package. I eventually picked it up off my ""i'm going to read that later"" shelf and just read it, finding it to be thought prevoking and beautiful. What surprised me greatly though...was it was also very amusing at times...it made me laugh. That was unexpected to say the least and it made the book more enjoyable and interesting to read. This book is beautiful and touching, and sometimes, when it makes you sad, you have to remind yourself that this is about a man's life...and it touches your heart even more. Worth the money...worth the read."
POSITIVE	"'Roxy Music's' second album was proof that this band was no novelty act! There really isn't a bad track on - ""For Your Pleasure"". I especially love - ""Do the Strand"", ""Strictly Confidential"", ""Editions of You"", ""In Every Dream Home a Heartache"" (with a great solo by Phil), ""The Bogus Man"", and of course the great title track of - ""For Your Pleasure"". Their early albums only get better with the test of time. Has anyone ever noticed a similarity between the music of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" (which made its London stage debut in June of '73), and Roxy's first two albums? Richard O'Brien even bears a close resemblance to - Brian Eno. Not that it matters, Roxy Music and the Rocky Horror have both stood the test of time!Love and Peace,Carlos Romero"
POSITIVE	nice pants as expected. great fit and quality. Use these for work and are quite durable. Will definitely purchase again
NEGATIVE	"After viewing TREASURE BUDDIES, one thing is clear: you can only take so much cuteness. Disney really needs to let this franchise go. I think even kids don't find the pups that interesting anymore? Even the addition of Babi the monkey doesn't help much since his cuteness wears thin. I know--I'm just a grumpy old coot but still an avid movie fan who likes an entertaining family film. After all, we're the ones who buy them!I generally enjoy Richard Riehle and Edward Hermann, but their characters and dialogue are just poorly written. The dog voice characterizations are generic and uninspired and interchangeable. Adding CGI effects to the black demon cats is embarrassingly bad. Kids today are more cognizant of good effects thanks to Harry Potter and Captain Jack. The ""buddies"" may have seemed lucrative at the time but enough is enough. An animated run on Nickelodeon might be more practical."
NEGATIVE	...It does not enable the codes!kids uder 13,don't buy this...all it will just do is erase your game!!!!
POSITIVE	Bought two peds...one for me and one for spouse. Easy to set up and use. Place in pocket in any position and it seems to record steps without difficulty. So far so good.
NEGATIVE	On the first day of playing with my cats, they managed to break the tie between the fly and the rod. My cat then proceeded to eat the string when I wasn't present. This is a cheap quality product and I would recommend that no one buys this product without knowing that it breaks easily!
NEGATIVE	as a avid bowhunter, I stand hunt for apx 3 hours in the morning. Here in Connecticut it can get real cold, So far I have not tried these in anything below 28 degrees. But I can tell you in all honesty, for activities such as mine where you dont move for 3 hours, they dont get the job done. They dont last and they dont get hot enough. The temps I tried them at is 29 to 38 degress. I have gone to the Grabber brand and have been quite happy.
NEGATIVE	I initially enjoyed this show but as I watched it, I found that it was repetitive and difficult to swallow. So many of the items that come in on this show are just not believable as just popping up for some pawn broker to buy. Also, as a resident of Las Vegas, I found that the people running this store are shockingly rude and full of themselves. Overall, fun to watch for a few episodes but lacks any real staying power. No idea how it has made so many seasons.
POSITIVE	California Dreamin Mamas and the Papas-60's Dreamin music from My High School years. Fun and sincere.
NEGATIVE	"After 8 years of owning Technics 1210 MkII's without one problem I came to the USA and bought a pair of TTx's because of the favourable price ($300 each) and the extra pitch control,key lock, and adjustable start/stop were all great features.They were good turntables for 2 years. I liked the extra features. The overall feel wasn't bad either, not as good quality as the techics but not a horrible feeling turntable by any rate. After 2 years one of them is starting to die. When I push the start button the platter doesn't ""catch"" and I have to give it a manual push to ""lock"" it on to the motor.I'm now looking for a second hand pair of Technics like I should have from the begining and saved myself some money, time, and effort. To anyone looking at buying turntables save yourself the heart-ache, 1200's will last you for ever and you can grow old and attached to your trusty, simple, WORKING, Technics.I will really miss the extra pitch control though!"
POSITIVE	"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. ""Of Coming Age In Mississippi"" shows segregation and Civil Rights hardships like it has never been shown before. You feel Anne Moody's heart break and understand segregation how it really was in the deep south. HIGHLY recommended to anyone who wants to open their eyes to another cultural period and understand it for what it really was. It is real, heartbreaking, and impossible to put down."
POSITIVE	The Konica-Minolta Maxxum 7D or Dynax 7D was a groundbreaking camera from a groundbreaking firm. This volume will give you everything you need, by way of information and diograms to smoothly master this Legendary Camera.Magic Latern is well known as an excellent source of information...and this work, by Peter K. Burian, is well written and well conceived.I would recommend it along with The PIP Expanded Guide to the Maxxum / Dynax 7D by Chris Weston.
NEGATIVE	what can I say it sucks. its loose and I'm trying to return. Don't buy the worse choice you'll ever make when it comes to seated calf machines
NEGATIVE	I recieved a Photoshop CS3 not Photoshop CS3 Extended.it was also a pirated version so i recieved no code to use it.
POSITIVE	I love soundtracks, and by far this is the best one I have ever listened to. You can get lost in the wonderfully composed music. It takes you back to the movie in every way. I can hear Peter's voice, and I can picture the movements they make as I sit back and listen to the songs. For anyone who enjoys music, this is a beautiful and extraordinary score to listen to. I would definately recommend this to everyone, even if you haven't seen the movie. Just picturing the movements from the movie is as good, if not better, then being taken back to the movie. The emotion that James Newton Howard put into the music is amazing, and its emotion that you can feel. Both the suspense and the excitement are beautifully mastered in the songs. This is a perfect soundtrack to an even better movie.
POSITIVE	Rob isn't just a savvy businessman; he's an entrepreneur. The alpha-entrepreneur. Rob's mentorship has helped guide our startup, PatientKeeper, Inc. (formerly Virtmed), from a prefinanced venture to a formidable company that has reshaped the mobile computing landscape.Much of Rob's guidance is incorporated in this book. Read it.
NEGATIVE	How can anyone make a choice when you cannot see what the other designs look like before purchase. I would be upset if I were the seller and my customers could not view anything other than the pine cone design.I moved on to other purchases and I will bet others did the same...
POSITIVE	Author has given good thaught about presenting the JINI technology to not only developers but also for the analysts, architects and managers of distributed application development.Author has given insight on the JINI technology and its role in distributed environment by comparing with the currently available technologies such as CORBA, RMI and DCOM+
NEGATIVE	I used this tool for about two weeks. Previous reviewer said you cant get metal cutting wheels for it he is wrong, they are readily available at every home center and hardware store- standard 4.5 inch metal cutting wheels.This tool totally sucks, battery life is horrible I cut 3 pieces of 1/2 rebar and the battery was spent. I cut thru 18gagesheet metal and the battery lasted less than 40 seconds.All the metal shavings you cut get magnetically attached to the tool body and get sucked into the motor, which will lead to disaster.Also for cutting applications the handle faces the wrong way and is not comforable to use.BADDDD tool!!!!!!1
NEGATIVE	i don't think this product values this price. I buy it for internet calling, but i don't think there are any change after i use it.
NEGATIVE	I usually don't write reviews, but felt I had to include my feedback. I love the Rainbow Lite Prenatals and was excited to try these vitamins for my kids. I was impressed by the nutritional information. However, they taste AWFUL and my kids refuse to eat them. They are not picky eaters and have easily taken many other kinds of vitamins. After tasting a tiny bite myself, I don't blame them. These vitamins taste disgusting, and if kids won't eat them, what's the point?
POSITIVE	This book really gets to the core of J2ME. Keogh writes with a no-nonsense, down to business style that gets right to the heart of the topic. He covers all the different parts of J2ME. Along the way he points out opportunities for optimization and how to access built-in calendars, address and to do list databases. You'll find J2ME, The Complete Reference a valuable addition to your library because it contains practical information that you won't find anywhere on the Internet.
POSITIVE	Authentic American Civil War era music and sounds of the conflict with excellent narration using the words of the participants. The finest example of music of that period played with the excellence of the Eastman Wind Ensemble. You will treasure the music and listen often.
POSITIVE	This CD pays for itself a hundredfold or more. Warped Tour, one of the most popular and influential Punk Rock Concerts out there, now makes its way into your stereo. With 52 tracks of the biggest bands in the North East US, for a price lower than most CD's, Warped Tour is far superior to any regular CD.The benefits of compilation CD's include popularity. The songs played at the concert are those that the bands feel are the most popular or influential among their songs, and are usually the best.The Warped Tour CD is a very nice buy for most teenagers interested in punk rock, and alternative rock, and is recommended for everyone.
NEGATIVE	i wanted to return it because the water is only dripping out of the faucethowever its been over 30 days so i can'tthe water tastes pretty good and the filter seems to do its job but it comes out so slow that it is unusable.
POSITIVE	I love this book. It has so many natural and simple solutions to every sickness we get . I always reffer to it if I have cold or even if I have some beauty problems. Buy it !!!
POSITIVE	I bought three of these for my daughter and I. They work for charging but don't do audio. I read about the audio limitation before I purchased them so pleased to get three more chargers for a minimal price.
POSITIVE	This hand held game really gets players going wild. It is a frantic paced game as you hear the beep get faster and faster and you try to have your teammates guess the word you are assigned by the game. DO NOT try to make this into a travel game it will make the driver crazy!A great option on the game is a pass button, that way if someone doesnt know the word they can move on to another one.Words include basic household objects as well as current entertainers/cartoon caracters.
NEGATIVE	"I was not impressed with this book. The glowing reviews are a mystery to me. Miller seemed to begin one train of thought jump to another and back again. The lack of organization was overwhelming. The dry, unexpressive writing was disappointing. As a text this is muddled, as ""engrosing non-fiction"" utterly lacking. Furthermore, this book was extremely long. The length is not necessarily a negative in itself, but it is when it seems that nothing of substance is being said. The length of this book can be attributed to the constant reiteration and the poor organization. Pure facts are as difficult to weed out as it is to understand the structure. Very disappointing."
NEGATIVE	I want someone to explain to me how a 14 year old book on a computer technology is going to be any worth...
NEGATIVE	The specs says that will work for Dell PA-4, but the specs for the PA-4 are Output 20 volt, 3.5A, and the specs on your descripcion are Output 19V, 3.16A. Wiii it work like the PA-4?
NEGATIVE	This is the worst ORB Cd I have heard, It dosent sound like there other Cd's, Can I return it?
POSITIVE	"After the phenomenal success of Sheila E.'s debut album, ""The Glamourous Life"", she followed the next year (1985) with the moderately successful, ""Romance 1600"". ""Sister Fate"", her obvious ode to Prince, was the first release from this sophomore effort, and a very mundane number that lacked the ummf that the single ""Glamourous Life"" exuded . Next was ""Love Bizarre"" (her 12 minute plus duet with Prince)which actually saved the album from complete ennui and possibly diminished record sales. ""Dear Michealangelo"", ""Yellow"" and the title track itself are listenable, but really don't measure up to the fire of the songs on ""The Glamourous Life""."
POSITIVE	My husband gave me the Kindle for my birthday and it was the best gift he ever gave me (for my birthday). Even better than my laptop! I have arthritis in my hands so holding books has been painful for me. The Kindle is lighter and easier to hold than a book, and I am so happy to be able to read, read, read. Thanks, honey, for the wonderful 58th gift you've given me for my birthday. Now you all can figure out when I met my husband, and how old I am!
POSITIVE	When our adult children were small they loved this film. Now we have an eight year old who is extremely physically handicapped but is mentally alert. He absolutely loves this film. When I hold it up to see if he wants to watch it and he gets the biggest smile. It is a film that children never get tired of and we adults love it too. I had actually forgotten about this movie until I ran across it one day and I immediately ordered it. I am so glad it finally came out on DVD.
NEGATIVE	1. The Capture does not work, ever. Sometimes it completes, but the mpg has only a fraction of the DVD. And they crippled it anyway by no longer capturing from dvd files on a hard disk.2. If there is an easy way to edit out commercials from a video file, I can't find it.3. As far as I can tell, EMC ALWAYS re-encodes the video. So you either lose data from your original MPG, or waste space converting to a higher bit rate. Why can't it copy the MPG as is, it is really the same format as the DVD files anyway? TMPGEnc DVD Author does exactly that, it works great.The only thing I use EMC for is creating data discs, and it is not worth the price for that.
NEGATIVE	Part of the book is true.I have done a lot of research on this story.The same story was published 4 years before this was to of happened.Author has taken a folk tale and made a fortune by telling half truths.I am his great nephew.I have records to back this up.
NEGATIVE	I was very dissatisfied with this purchase because after I received the product, I found out that it was in a different language and I couldn't understand anything on the cd's.
POSITIVE	Very impressed with this collection of DVDs. The videography is the best I've ever seen in scenic, wildlife, and documentary videos. The tag line is the truth, it will give you a great seat to see the Planet Earth as you've never seen it before. Such a vast, unlimited viewing of our world. :)
NEGATIVE	But instead of the orchestra, we are treated to the wonderful sound of reverb, along with some very fine compression artifacts when the cannons go off. I was truly disappointed by the sound of this - it is the aural equivalent of mud and cotton, very mushy, hard to make out the details, and not something I really want to deal with. The conducting seems particularly heavy handed, as if the conductor wanted to make a name for himself by making his own slight alterations to the piece that, while not significant, are unnecessary and very irritating. Poor recording technique and a wierd performance, but wait! There's a warning on the label that the cannons are very loud!! Oh my, then this MUST be the recording to get to show off a [amt.] stereo in the bachelor pad - maybe the cannons will be so loud that your date will hop right into your lap!This is to classical music what a primer-grey muscle car is to a show of luxury automobiles.
POSITIVE	This was an entertaining movie if you like the hand held video camera type movies. It kept my interest through to the end. The ending was perfect in my opinion. The only complaint I have is there was a little too much screaming action going on, they could have had the same effect without the extra annoying screeches. That aside, it's worth a look.
POSITIVE	This is sort of like the bubble gum music of new age. But who cares? Its simple direct melodies, bouncy rhythms and colorful sound just get you hooked. It gets lots of play time in my CD collection.
POSITIVE	"People will argue which version of The Office is better, some will side with the UK version and some will side with the US version. If you were smart, you'd equally enjoy both of them. The dvd itself may be a bit expensive for only 6 episodes but the deleted scenes equal up to almost an hours worth of footage. Each of these episodes are cut at around 30-34 minutes, but when they air on nbc only 21 minutes can be shown. So these deleted scenes are just basic ""extra"" scenes... they're actually as funny as the regular show... so it's a great bonus. You really need to get this dvd, because you'll be playing it over and over again."
NEGATIVE	"Most of the facts mentioned in the book are incorrect. The style is biased. Might be useful only as an example of how the good history should NOT BE. I would no recommend this book to anybody serious about history.The authors claim of Karabagh being ""a historically Armenian land"" is definitely incorrect. The book does not have any factual evidence (except the fiction presented as ""facts"") behind its main point and is written in very hostile manner, full of hatred and racist remarks. However, that is a common tool of Armenian propaganda machine used in order to mislead the world community and hide the ethnic cleansing conducted by Armenian military units against the civilian Azerbaijani population of Karabagh and Armenia."
POSITIVE	In my high school years i used to go through my dads records. obviously one of them was aurthur brown.at the time i was into BLACK SABBATH ,IRON MAIDEN,the DOORS, KING DIAMOND and basically anything that was different and creative. I have to give it to AURTHUR BROWN he was completely original. He openened the door for so many bands after him both musically and expressively.I give credit to MARILYN MANSON for knowing who he is If you've ever listened to ther PORTRAIT OF AN AMERICAN FAMILY you'd know what i,m talkin about.ARTHUR BROWN has to be the ACID ROCK king!
POSITIVE	He healed me twice. Both were nothing short of miraculous. Angels worked through him no doubt. A very special book from a very special man. A must have. His energy comes through it and that is priceless.
NEGATIVE	Resurrection is a science fiction book by Arwen Elys Dayton. In it, two races of people from two different planets push each other to the brink of extinction and send teams eight light years to Earth in an attempt to recover long lost technology that could propel either race to a tactical advantage against the other.The story sounds interesting and certainly sounds like the backdrop for a great SciFi novel. The problem is that the characters are underdeveloped, the settings mundane, and the book itself never really picks up any momentum. By the time the reader gets to the end of the story, you're excited not because of what you're reading, but because it's almost over.I'm surprised there are so many rave reviews for the book. This is mediocre science fiction at best.
NEGATIVE	I offer this assessment with a certain amount of sorrow and I offer it on behalf of myself and the friend who I gave this item for Christmas last year. I actually liked the knock box in terms of function. But I'm unhappy with the company response when I attempted to purchase replacement rubber grommets that split after a short time. I was told to buy the entire knock box bar and that was my only recourse. I found this to be very poor customer support. You can't tell me they don't have the rubber grommets they could sell at a fraction of the cost. Plus I don't like scrapping a perfectly good piece of metal. Very not green.
NEGATIVE	I am not pleased with this item. It is NOT a book. I don't really even know what to call it. It is folded over with some pages glued on the inside. It has a lovely poster if you want to pay that much money for a poster. It is more like cliff notes for a book. I very disappointed and feel like I've been had.
POSITIVE	"This speaker system is wonderful!! The sound quality is very very good and the subwoofer is very powerful. It's definitely a keeper, for a long long time. Absolutely no complaints from this audio freak <g>I love the remote control too. Now I can lie down on the nearby sofa and listen to audio programs with total control :)It has an auxiliary input jack on top of the subwoofer. This is a great function for me. With a good A/V selector (Sony's SB-V40S A/V Selector is the one I have, which has an Output 2 audio output with stereo mini jack), now I can also use this PC speaker system for my nearby 13"" TV, DVD player, VCR, and camcorder. It's wonderful!!In general, great design and awesome sound!! I recommend it very strongly!!"
NEGATIVE	Don't buy this card. Or anything from LSI.This card would fail (the driver would crash) if you do anything involving high disk throughput. Copy a 40 mb file from another machine across the LAN? The computer this card is installed in would bluescreen.LSI customer support sent me a couple of BIOS updates and drivers that basically rendered my computer completely unable to boot. One of the largest wastes of money I've had in a while, especially considering the multiple evenings I've spent trying to fix this thing.Buyer beware.
POSITIVE	As, I stated above, this book is thrilling! I couldn't put it down.I am an inspiring author and this book put more fuel into my fire. I bought thebook because it was written by an African American female. That weekend, I went to thebookstore and bought every Octavia Butler book I saw. I am anxiously awaiting morework from this talented author.K. Evans
POSITIVE	All ink cartidges are not the same. I believe in using a high quality ink cartridge in my high quality Brother multi-function center.
POSITIVE	A true story about desparate research into a tragic medical condition, brought to life beautifully. Sad, but thought provoking, it stays with you long after the movie is over. Watch it with a box of Kleenex.
POSITIVE	This book is a very impressive piece of work. Shattan is very fair when he writes about each and every person, no matter what their political stripe. From Churchill's prescient knowledge of what must be done to Truman's acknowledgement of the danger that Communism posed to Adenauer's firm and unwavering alignment with the West to Solzihentisyn(sp?) showing how the Cold War was really a moral struggle to Pope John Paul II's unwavering determination to free Poland to Ronald Reagan who ultimately caused the end of the Cold War; even though it came under Bush's administration; Shattan demonstrates a keen eye for details and an excellent sense of analysis. This is well worth reading for anyone interested in the Cold War.
POSITIVE	If you have already read Think & Grow Rich or haven't and are contemplting on which book to buy, I say in either case buy this book.Think & Grow Rich Action Pack is like a personal development workshop in print form. It make a study of the famous Hill principles. Makes them jump to life and cements them into your mind.I don't know why Napolean Hill didn't do this to begin with.If you haven't already bought Think & Grow Rich, just buy this one. It has the entire book followed by the action guide.You will soon find out why Think & Grow Rich has been heralded as the best personal development book of all time.And if you have already read Think & Grow Rich, you will learn more and uncover more riches than ever before.The action guide brings the principles to life in a way never offered before.This is aust read and a must do for everyone serious about personal success.Good luck.
POSITIVE	I was introduced to Dan O'Neils Odd Bodkins cartoons by one of my fellow Army inductees while stationed in Europe in 1972. He was from San Francisco and had been fortunate enough to read these cartoons when they were originally run in the San Francisco Chronicle in the late 60s. I still remember how ecstatic he was when he got the copy from home. The humor is loony lampooning political and religious satire; Doonesbury is watered down and very politically correct by comparison.In the Sideways (after the Forward) Dan O'Neil writes about his original editors requirements to keep Sex, Drugs, Politics and Religion out of the strip, as he says he managed to keep sex out.If you want to get a taste of how anti-war and anti-establishment the late 60's were, make the effort to track down a copy and enjoy the ride.
POSITIVE	This iron cuts my ironiong time in half. It is easy to use, outperforms every iron I've ever used, and makes the task of ironing fun and rewarding. What other small appliance can you say that about?
POSITIVE	This video taught both my boys there capital letters prior to the age of 2. I didn't even realize how much they were retaining until they brought me refrigerator magnets or letter shaped bathtub sponges telling me what the letters were. WONDERFUL video, and keeps their attention.
NEGATIVE	I made a mistake ... i didnt read the reviews so i will chalk this up as a lost but i so didnt want to send it back but i was very un happy with the band it was hallow and cheap it made the watch feel like a cheap watch , which it is not but i paid the 10 bucks and sent it back ... but thanks amazon for the refund it came right on time ..
POSITIVE	Just got the heat pack today. When I got it the packaging around the product was open, not sure if it was previously opened or if it was just faulty packaging.But I've already heated it up twice and it works great! It puts out a lot of moist heat, the back of my t shirt is already damp from it.When I got up today I was having lots of back pain, from a car accident I was in back in 2010. It took about 2 minutes with this product on my back before the pain went away. This product is big enough to cover the entire back, so if your like me and don't know where the back pain will shift next, this is an excellent solution! I have not yet noticed any odor coming off of it, but if I do I'll be sure to comment on this post.Overall great product! I completely recommend it!
NEGATIVE	Ok we all know that Sealab 2020 is a CLASSIC 1972 cartoon. So where in the HELL is the DVD for the complete series? A CLASSIC like Sealab has NO DVD? COME ON PEOPLE!!! Give us the DVD, PLEASE!!!
NEGATIVE	I wanted to lose 15 lbs so i used this shake with 1 scoop of the herbalife protein, and 3 weeks later, still no weight loss. I would not recommend this product for weight loss, but rather breakfast. It filled me up when i drank it, but I decided to go back to eating chicken twice a day for weight loss and yogurt for b'fast. This definitely works. I just wanted something simpler, but this product is definitely not it for me. I was even doing cardio while using herbalife and it didn't work. I will not be repurchasing this product.
POSITIVE	"It connects my Pentax 10x50 binoculars to my 60"" Vista tripod. Both ends are easy to attach and detach, and the molded plastic body feels solid. It meets my expectations at a good price."
POSITIVE	"I was glad that Sharpie is still making permanent markers with the old formula. I am sick and tired of wasting my money on the ""new and improved"" ""safe to now eat"" products that no longer work. The non toxic formula marker is not permanent. But apparently you can now eat them. If you want a real permanent marker buy the industrial Sharpie."
NEGATIVE	An interesting premise is ruined by a director's desire to make a name for himself through imagery.If you can bare to keep your mind switched on, for what must be the dullest film of all-time, then you'll see some beautiful design and cinematography. Also in shot you may see the deadest actors this side of 'Zombie Flesheaters'. I like Jonny Depp as an actor and, being male, I like Charlize Theron too but... God knows what they were thinking.I've seen my fair share of boring films but they can usually at least prick my attention with a little fast-pacing every-so-often but, as I said, the film is simply a long string of nice looking but inconsequential set-pieces.Watch Abel Ferrara's 'Body Snatchers' instead, for a relevant update of 50s B-movie ideas.
POSITIVE	Well I just purchased this air purifier after extensive research on-line--this machine seemed like it was the best value and quality for its price range. There are other machines ranked a bit higher but they will cost at least $100-$200 more and it didn't seem like you would begetting that much more value. I decided if we liked this one in our bedroom it would still be cheaper to buy a second one for our living room than to buy one of the other brand's larger and more expensive versions.It came today and within an hour my boyfriend and I both seemed to already notice a difference. The air feels fresher and cleaner--and smells better. Not to mention it is really quiet--even on high. The only mode that is a bit more noticeable is Turbo and even that just sounds like a fan turned on high. It was easy to set-up and is easy to use. I will have to check back in again after a longer period of use to report on whether we experience a long term noticeable difference on our allergies.
NEGATIVE	I bought this for my wife, and she was thrilled with it for about 3 months. It worked great during all that time and then all of a sudden it stopped producing any real froth. It started just producing some bubbles that quickly dissipated, leaving the milk as flat as before. Changing batteries doesn't fix it; it appears that it simply doesn't have the RPM it used to have and can't do the job anymore.Having gone back and reading more of the negative reviews, it seems this is a common thing. Some get their Aerolatte in this state from the get-go and for some it works for a while and then slows down like it did for us. It's such a shame because it worked really well while it lasted. If it was half the price, I might consider buying a new one, but at this price it's just not worth it. I will look for an alternative.
POSITIVE	Using Examkrackers books and Audio Osmosis study guide, my MCAT score jumped 4 points from a 32 to a 36.Good to listen to while doing mind-numbing work, or running, or sleeping.
POSITIVE	Though most of the teen movies out there are bad (loser, she's all that, I know what you did last summer), ten things I hate about stands as out as a well written well thought out movie that will please teens as well those who are not teens. This is movie is actually a decent romantic movie like high fidelity and keeping the faith. I liked to see a group of young actos playing this modern day adaptation of taming the schrew.
NEGATIVE	It does what it is supposed to do.Don't even think about using it for French Press.
POSITIVE	This is a good product for it's price-range. It is rugged and compact. However there are some annoying quirks which could have been avoided. e.g. No backlight, having to cycle through FM1/FM2/AM1/AM2 in order to go to a preset, a lock button that's difficult to use.
POSITIVE	I bought this to scan my family's 35mm slide collection. I'm thoroughly impressed with the quality of the output. The software is a little bit clunky, but it works. I'm so pleased with how this is working that I'm going to also scan the family collection of photos and negatives. Worth every penny!!
POSITIVE	After buying Rachel Ray, and Paulla Dean, pan sets that didn't last. I spent the extra money and bought an real pan set. I was worried that it not being non-stick I would have a hard time with sticking, but with a spray or a little oil. No problems. My only problem is the discoloring on the bottom of the pan from my dish washer.
POSITIVE	As advertised, shipped quickly, good price. Worked fine. Longevity yet to be determined, but right now I would order this item again.
POSITIVE	This is a great book for kids who are afraid of what lies behind their starircase or under their bed. It makes up silly names for mosters and its shows that they aren't mean or scary just funny looking. It's not only a great book for kids who are afraid of monsters but for any kid who loves to read books that rhyme and joke around.
POSITIVE	"Don't get me wrong the scope is a fine quality scope but for the price but maybe I should have paid the extra $70 for the 4-14x40 instead. I know, the quest never ends!The scope at the highest magnification x9 is just right for 100 yards at the rifle range but it would be a challenge for shooting at target further than that and knowing your not hoping and praying you'll hit the 12"" bulls eye target.To compensate though is the BDC reticle which I have not yet had a chance to prove at a farther distance tha 100 yards.Since the target object would really be visually small looking through the scope at the max 600 yards it would really be interesting at that distance if you can really hit the target!"
NEGATIVE	If you are just beginning to learn about raw food or living food - leave this book on the shelf for a few years. It's long. It's boring. It's in depth. It reads a like a text book.
NEGATIVE	"doesn't play on newer computer. Made the changes to the compability as instructed by others. have many of the older Living Books CD games and after making the changes they are fine. NOT the GT Interactive CDs ""Just Me & My Dad"" and ""Just Me & My Grandpa"". they just won't play. bummer. They played on the old computer ... Looking for an old computer so they can be played."
POSITIVE	"This appears to be the only ""cheesecake"" DVD featuring Russian tennis star Anna Kournikova. There are multiple Kournikova wall calendars. But this is the only calendar video that I've found.So ... what's not to like?Anna's hot and ... she's even pretty good at tennis. Say what you want about Anna not having the ""game"" to go along with her looks, but she has inspired many Russian women to follow in her wake, including Maria Sharapova, Anastasia Myskina, Elena Dementieva, Svetlana Kuznetsova, Nadia Petrova and Vera Zvonareva.But if you are somehow expecting Anna to be nude, I'm afraid you'll be sorely disappointed. Hot she is. Nude she's not. Give it a shot."
NEGATIVE	"Having recently seen ""Legally Blonde"" I was thrilled to hear that the sequel, ""Legally Blonde 2"" was coming out. Yet upon seeing what I had hoped to be a funny, witty and charming film I found only a rediculous, humorless, and ultimately shallow film. The acting ranged from average to bad, but honestly I did not expect much in this department. The jokes, which using politics as a platform, should have been histarical but they were only a rehashing of the first film. What litte new material was used in this film was pratically pointless and gained more sighs and groans then anything else. ""Legally Blonde 2"" is in short, since to even mention the inane plot would be a waste of everyone's time, a lackluster summer sequel. If you have not seen the first film watch it, it is a very charming movie. Those whom have seen the original, as well as those whom have not, are just a well to save your money and avoid this trash. Rated PG-13 for adult lanugage and sexual humor."
NEGATIVE	I feel i have a dry sense of humor. This one just didn't do it for me, but it did have a few moments.
NEGATIVE	I've never had this happen before in any tool. One of the winding pickups on the armature broke off. When I opened up the motor, the pickup was loose in the case. One of the brushes had gotten jammed into the armature.Other than that, I found it to be an okay router. Plenty of power, but weight \ balance wise it was hard to use it smoothly. So I left it permanently mounted in my router table, and bought a Hitachi router for hand use. I am much happier using the Hitachi free hand than I was with the Skil. I won't miss this one.
NEGATIVE	The most boring book ever. No theory, no ideas, just page after page of stuff you already know. There is almost 200 pages on Alchemist. Nuff said.
POSITIVE	this film is terrific to the end,Barbara Eden gives 100% in everything she does.
NEGATIVE	"I'm really disappointed in my new Corelle Coordinates Callaway 2-1/5 qt. whistling teakettle. First of all, I can't boil 2 quarts of water without it boiling over. I frequently wish to boil just 2 quarts to make iced tea for my family or church events. When I do boil water and try to pour it out, it runs back and makes a mess on my kitchen counter or on the table. If I leave the lever down over the spout while it boils, I have to use a potholder to lift it to be able to pour the water out. The noise it makes when the water boils is not a ""whistle"", but a low rumble. I do like the outside design. Right now I'm shopping for a new teakettle and it won't be a Corelle brand."
NEGATIVE	Cannot say that I enjoyed reading this book, because I did not approve of a lot of the things the author included. However, I did find some of the main points interesting to create a story. But definitely not the type of good book to read, nor would I recommend it.
NEGATIVE	"I bought a bottle of this stuff at Auto Zone. I carefully followed the instructions when applying it to my car, but it did not remove any of the scratches, no matter how minor they were and no matter how hard I tried. Very disappointed, I returned the product to Auto Zone. I doubt all the ""positive"" feedback on this product."
NEGATIVE	I'll keep this short and sweet. I've had the Zen Xtra 40GB for about a month. I'm returning it tomorrow (hopefully) to get an iPod.Pros:- Plenty of space- 1/2 the cost of a 40GB iPodCons:- User interface is difficult to use; jog dial isn't very easy to manipulate- Poorly designed software (buggy and doesn't work 50% of the time)- EAX sound field manipulation is garbage - don't use it- Can't use it as an external hard drive w/o extra drivers- Bigger than shirt pocket- Sync capability is practically useless and error-prone (200 of my files wouldn't sync thru Creative's driver)The only redeeming thing about the Zen is a third-party shareware product called Notmad Explorer which is great - but unfortunately it uses the Creative driver and the Zen itself, so it's not much better.
POSITIVE	This was hilarious-- but I suggest that you have already read the original because it's much less funny and entertaining if you haven't.
NEGATIVE	The connector did not link my Sony and Olympus camera cables with USB output and the USB-Male A -3x RCA AVA/V cable lead 5 ft that I had purchased on amazon.com website.Both cameras did not connect to the TV.
NEGATIVE	As the seasons wear on Criss is relying more on stuff that can only be done on TV with lots of presetup, lots of fake audiences, lots of camera angles and even CGI. Too much audience interview and less substance as well. A real Shame. Fun to watch but keep in mind it's just TV. They could've hired any actor to do most of the stuff being done. Notice that there is no disclaimer about camera angles, etc. Be interesting to see season 3; Maybe by then it will all be CGI and he can just phone it in.
POSITIVE	I am a sometime amateur turner, but due to my work situation, unfortunately I spend much more time reading about turning than turning. Not good. Gotta get that fixed.So, I've read some of the best (Raffan, Darlow, etc.), but I fould Chapman's book truly inspirational. It includes information on techniques, of course, but in doing so, seemingy inadvertently showcases a wide variety of very, very good design executed very, wery well. More importantly, from my viewpoint, almost all appears to be well within the range of an intermediate turner. Recommended!
NEGATIVE	A nice piece of hardware but that all.There is absolutely no functionality other than capturing the MPG file to the MAC.For those who are not aware mpg2 is virtually not supported on the Mac.The I-life suite offers no mpg editing nor does the Final cut express.For this hardware to claim to be for the Mac one would assume that it would export into I-Movie or offer some sort of mpg editing software.To be fair what it does it does well, but without even the most basic editing functions I had to return my unit. And certainly would warn others off.
NEGATIVE	While the sound was good for it's price, I will never buy this again. All 6 pairs (or even more, I lost track) have either completely broken, got sound muffled, or one piece does not emit sound. I bought one, that broke, warranty covered it, it broke again. I bought a 3rd one, broke, 4th one broke, warranted 5th one broke, then after another month my 6th one broke. I'm tired of spending $30 every month. I regret buying this and now I have moved on to the utterly amazing Klipsch Image S4s, which sounds on par with Shure SE310 and many others worth 3 times its $80 dollar value. While it may seem expensive, it is actually a lot cheaper since it will last you longer, compared to my 6 pairs which lasted me about 8 months for about $140 + $60 warranty covered ones. Honestly, just avoid these.
POSITIVE	this was a great read. i dont read much but finally a book i couldnt put down. if this was made into a movie i would watch it so much i would know it word for word.
POSITIVE	"Even though Bela's movies are ""before my time,"" I can't help but appreciate his roles in these low budget flicks of yesteryear. I love the premise of this movie and can see a modern variation on this theme of giant bats that ""sever the jugular"" of their victims.As a warning to all, do yourselves a favor and only buy the one which states that the movie was released by the Bela Lugosi Estate since this version uses the original film elements to present a nice, crisp picture. Bela Lugosi Jr. offers running commentary during the film as one of the Extras. He looks well preserved for his age if you get my drift.Anyway, a fun movie to watch. Don't take it too seriously. After all, it is a 1940s B-Grade horror movie. Just sit back and enjoy the show. And don't forget the popcorn for crying out loud!"
NEGATIVE	"Movies like Something Borrowed are the reason romantic comedies have earned such a bad reputation. Bad writing, lame characters, clichéd plot, Kate Hudson: all the ingredients are there, and the result is predictable and dull. How I miss real romantic comedies, like ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Kissing Jessica Stein."" I wonder what happened to them and why they've been replaced with this tripe that's neither romantic nor funny."
NEGATIVE	Wow! This is just about the creepiest kid's book I've ever read. It is especially disturbing that it has obviously been produced with such earnestness and sincerity. I especially agree with the other reviewer who stated that there is no middle ground with this book that I've ever heard of. You either LOVE it, or are very creeped out by it...I'm sorry gals, but a mother sneaking into her grown son's house and crawling across the floor in a darkened room sounds more like stalking, than unconditional love.I have read it a few times to my daughter and she likes it good enough. Of course, she is a kid, she likes EVERYTHING I read to her. Seen through her eyes, it is just a story. She doesn't have enough life experience to get creeped out by it like me and my wife do.(shiver...)
NEGATIVE	This unit started out pretty good, although it was very tough to clamp on and off a car tire valve, losing a good amount of air each time. I used it about 8 times, and this last time it shut itself down after about 6 minutes of continuous use. It's now dead. I'll be purchasing a 'real' air compressor next.
NEGATIVE	OMG I cant believe i actually finished this book. It is a miracle that this book ever started the vampire crazzzzzzze...Sry i fell asleep writing this review of the most boring book I've ever read. The only reason i fought to finish it is to say i went through it . Like climbing a mountian..why because it was there.....Now to read something more interesting like my lawn mowers owners manual.
NEGATIVE	There are a lot of errors in this dictionary. Many of them are taken from the older missionary dictionaries. And the spelling is hard to read. If you are serious about learning Lakota, the only truly reliable dictionary is theNew Lakota Dictionary.
POSITIVE	My son enjoyed this book. It was an easy read for a 7 year old, with nice pictures and interesting facts. Probably perfect for a 5 or 6 year old.
POSITIVE	What can I say about Slaughterhouse-Five, besides that it is a literary work of art. I love Kurt Vonnegut's dark humor and satirical writing style. This is one of my favorite books of all time.
POSITIVE	As a great fan of Sandra Brown, I was very disappointed with the ending of this book. In the beginning, the book started out great, but the ending of the book was not what I expected. I hope the next book that I bought won't be disappointing at the end as well.
NEGATIVE	I got bored with this book from the very beginning. I guess it just wasn't my type of book. Sorry.
NEGATIVE	"Of course the songs are not exactly the same, but this is an exact copyof their wonderful ""the Tractors"" CD that every music lover should own.Therefore there's nothing new about this and at the and it's sorepetitive that it hurts the ears and I must admit I even couldn'tfinish listening to it. I love honky tonk but not the ""same"" song 9times in a row. The remaining one sure is a nice ballad and the onlyhighlight."
NEGATIVE	I am vey disappointed because up till this momment I have not received this book. I have called amazon and they told me to wait. It is more than a month now, still no book. I want my money back ASAP.
POSITIVE	I had a Panasonic previously which I loved and used until even new blades and foils weren't enough. I bought the untra cheap model with the yellow trim but it felt like a toy and worse, shaved like one.But this model cuts like a dream. I dry shave my leathery old face and it works a treat. I even use it to keep my shaved head slick, which allows hte current summer heat to disspate just a bit better. I highly recommend this shaver. I haven't used the cleaner yet but I believe it will be good too just based on how good the shaver is to use.
NEGATIVE	Stay away from this piece of garbage; try the original version if available.
NEGATIVE	This case is alright. That is the best that I can say about it. It is very flimsy. I was expecting it to be a bit more durable...like the standard Plano tackle box. When the case is closed, it feels misaligned, as if it may come open at any minute. When the case is open, it's flimsiness is immediately evident. I would spend the money on something more rigid next time. It will serve it's purpose for the time being. Caveat emptor.
POSITIVE	My husband was skeptical of getting this. But after making a couple of dinners with it, he is sold. We absolutely love this machine. Very easy to clean. Important to keep kids away--it does get very hot to touch. We use our island to set it up on to cook. The reconditioned unit we bought had no blemishes-I couldn't tell it was not a brand new, never opened machine.
POSITIVE	"John Norum's ""Optimus"" is a an incendiary cocktail that burns,without variation, into a symphonious burst of poetic expressions. The guitar work is consistent and pleasantly harsh, from beginning to end and the songs are even more interesting as they are stressed by John's ferocious and turbulent vocals.This album is -required by rule- for people that enjoy his work and it is a great place to start for new listeners interested or curious about his music.""Optimum"" creation!"
POSITIVE	Contains 8 Songs With AND Without Lead Demonstration Vocals (16 Tracks Total).1. Cuando Me Miras Asi2. Con Ella3. Despues De Ti Que4. Lloran Las Rosas5. Lloviendo Estrellas6. Lo Mejor De Mi7. Manana Manana8. Si Tu Me Amaras
NEGATIVE	"The original KitchenAid mixers were manufactured by the consumer division of Hobart.In 1986, Hobart decided to concentrate on the professional market, and sold off their consumer division, KitchenAid, to Whirlpool. Since then it has been one problem after another with several of the models.They maintain the visual appearance because of the reputation,but cheapen the insides with plastic gears that fail regularly.If you can find one, buy a used KitchenAid/Hobart machine.On the nameplate it will say ""KitchenAid by Hobart"".Those are the machines that last forever. If it doesn't say HOBART,don't spend your $$$."
POSITIVE	This movie is awesome. It is very entertaining for adults and kids alike. And the characters are adorable. This is one of those movies you can watch over and over again.Gromit has always been one of my favourite characters and he shines in this film. Another winner from the guys that brought us chicken run, this is their best yet...
NEGATIVE	I wish I had waited to read more reviews on Amazon before I bought this game. It's good... it's Tetris, so you already know more or less what it's all about. But it's just not great. Tetris DX for Game Boy Color is much better. This new Tetris does not have a battery back up, and it does not have as many good game variations either. In addition, while they put a lot of effort into adding graphics and animations, it actually takes away from the game. I wish I could recommend it, but I just can't.
NEGATIVE	The product I received is Vortex II. I looks diferente from the one displayed on this article. Looks weak and really is. I am not sure if was worth to buy it.
POSITIVE	I love this series collection. The playback has been clean as well as the audio. I've been eagerly anticipating its arrival and am not disappointed.
NEGATIVE	"I was disappointed to see a cheap looking mirror when I opened the box. The mirror was made of cheap a plastic. The reflected image (my face...) was totally distorted. The supplied 2-sided sticker could not hold the mirror on the tiles and I had to use RTV in order to attach it to the shower wall. After couple of weeks the ""fogless"" mirror became covered with fog the moment I opened the hot water in the shower. The whole mirror surface became quite ""matte"" after some time, and ""mirror stains"" (or peelings) appeared on the mirror edges and the plastic holder.Why 2 start and not 1? - Because for over 2 years I am spraying anti-fog spray on the mirror before I start shaving, and so I manage to do the job. But now I had it, and I am looking for a different mirror."
NEGATIVE	I chose this book because I'm getting married in June and I have no idea what I want my cake to look like. I thought this book would be filled with pages of designs...I was very disappointed.
POSITIVE	I love my Keurig 70 it works wonderfully without any problems. It was shipped quickly & packaged nicely upon arriving. I can't complain about the price either it was a great packaged deal.
POSITIVE	Frequency is a movie that entertains, thrills, and stimulates, but all that can be ruined if you think too much about it. Dennis Quaid plays Frank Sullivan, a firefighter killed in a fire in 1969. Thirty years later, his son, John (played by James Caviezel), finds his father's old ham radio. Through the miracle of the Aurora Borealis (how many of THOSE do you see in New York?), they manage to talk to each other through the ages. Through this communication, John saves his father's life, but he changes history so that a famous murderer is back on the lam, and he is going to kill John's wife. So far, so good. But soon after, inconsistencies pop up. All in all however, this movie is a fine story that was short-changed in the theatres. I would recommend it to anybody who likes these kind of cross-time magical movies.
POSITIVE	"Like the other reviewers here, I too, counted THREE INTO ONE as one of the best anthologies by the pre-Ure Ultravox. That is, until this set came along. This generous anthology serves up all the key tracks - from the Eno-produced ""The Wild, The Beautiful And The Damned"" to ""My Sex"" and ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"", this version of Ultravox was the missing link between Roxy Music and Adam Ant, punk and new wave, glam and art-rock. Its influence on everything that came out of the U.K. in the eighties can't be measured. You certainly don't need all three Island albums; this set is absolutely all you require and you should do so without guilt or remorse. Recommended."
NEGATIVE	"While Mr. Cuneo discusses each of the various Catholic positions taken by the persons and groups he mentions with some fairness (at least with respect to each other), all positions a serious Catholic might take were treated equally lightly, as if none of them could be taken seriously. One really gets the feeling that he exhibits each of them like animals in a zoo: ""...and in this cage we have the anti-abortionists, and over there are the sedevacantists...oh, look; the sedevacantists are making another pope; isn't that cute!"" At least one source is misquoted so as to make an invalid point. Although it is written so as to seem fair and objective, it actually gives the reader no good reason to join any of the fine groups of those who take their Faith seriously."
POSITIVE	I got these boots for 3 reasons. 1. I am a huge wonder woman fan. 2. I wanted to dress up as wonder woman for halloween (and I did, 3. I wanted them to wear them in my wedding (and I did!) I got these boots quickly and they were in beautiful shape! The fit perfectly and it was nice to wear heels that didn't make me feet ache 20min after putting them on. I would recommend these to anyone!
NEGATIVE	I don't understand the positive reviews on this silly wrist strap. It is VERY uncomfortable and scratchy. Even if I did were it longer than 5 minutes, it is impossible to figure out if you have it on the right spot to be effective.
POSITIVE	Delivered within two days of the order. Had everything I needed to repair the stripped threads in a milling vice; drill bit, threaded insert, and insertion tool and instructions.Helicoil 5521-5 5/16-18 Inch Coarse Thread Repair Kit
POSITIVE	Very pleased... Have had several Canon SureShot cameras and all have performed well. Would recommend this brand to others who are still using film!
POSITIVE	Off the Record is a terrific book. Anyone who has a love of music, history, or even photography, this book presents itself as a must have. It is the ultimate liner note. Original in its concept, the book takes a sincere and valuable look into songwriting and its place in history. The accompaning stories are touching and authentic, adding a new depth to the music, and time when it was first heard. After reading, the same music i heard so many years before brought me back to those wonderful places, except this time filled with the wealth of background and the artists intent.
NEGATIVE	Collective groans from Book Club seduced by good reviews (who writes these?). Ugly, tedious. Couldn't finish it. Writer is skilled with words though. Would have made a better short story.Book arrived promptly. It was not 'new' as specified but nevertheless in very good condition. Would buy from this vendor again.
NEGATIVE	My DVD's do not play. They continue to freeze up and are not watchable. I will have to purchase all 3 seasons again!!
POSITIVE	"If you just start learning Perl, this is definitely a good book to start with. You can build a solid foundation of Perl skills with this book. However, if you are serious with Perl, you will need more advanced books like ""programming with Perl""."
POSITIVE	Have long, fine hair...& am now using this with my hot rollers...The Redken product made my hair positively CRUNCHY..(Tossed it out!).. This bottle is pretty small for someone with long hair, but gotta have something. It keeps the curls pretty well and adds some shine. Will keep using till I find something better....
POSITIVE	I was amazed at how much a tamper could change the flavor of my home-brew compared to just hand compression. Much smoother, much less bitterness now.Compliments to Vaneli's service people (especially Keli). I ordered the wrong size tamper initially, Vaneli's let me swap it with no questions. Turnaround was very amazingly quick.
NEGATIVE	This book is absolutely horrible. I bought this book for my third trip to Europe and it is utterly nerve-wracking and annoying to read and follow. It is very vague and doesn't help at all for planning a trip. Many times it bolds locations without giving any information about them. The restaurant recommendations are also completely useless. Most of the information in the book is just there to fill up pages. Search for another book or look online for places to visit and eat. This book actually made the weeks in Europe WORSE.
POSITIVE	In his article, Ethnographic Critique and Technoscientific Narratives: The old mole, ethical plateaux, and the governance of emergent biosocial polities, in Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry (25: 355-93. 2001)Michael M.J. Fischer uses this book as a juxtaposition to ethnographic descriptions of bio-ethical realties. It's rather interesting and may possibly add some insight into the novel
NEGATIVE	"Imagine you are a woman living in the United States, and a foreign fighter (Pick any of the convenient enemies - The Soviets, Al Qaida, The French, etc) invades your town, killing your husband and trying to destroy your very way of life.Imagine again, that within 6 months, he has learned everything there is to know about being an American, and has embraced the American culture and now becomes a leader in the fight against his own countrymen. So dedicated is he to his new ""family"", that he even goes into battle wearing your dead husband's uniform. Did I mention that you have fallen madly in love with him?If this sounds too far-fetched to be true, imagine the same story, only you are Japanese, a race and culture renowned for excluding outsiders and foreigners, as well as a culture that is almost impenetrable in its subtlety.Unbelieveable, isn't it? Apparently, not if you're Tom Cruise."
POSITIVE	I used this tape for 3 years to build strength. I watched it every morning from 5-20 mins at a time as I was getting over back pain and other problems. It got me in great shape to start taking classes. I have not been injured since. This tape is slow, easy to follow, brilliant in its line up of Asanas, and great for strengthening. I recommend it to EVERYONE who wants to start out yoga cheaply, by watching a video at home!
NEGATIVE	I wanted a dvd of this to show my class, and was sad to see the price so high here. I googled it once and found it through other places for 20 bucks.
NEGATIVE	They really should release a 2nd edition with new techniques, and remove the old, disproven stuff (double-checked locking works???). We're on the brink of Java 1.5, this book is pure 1.1.Spend your money on Effective Java by Joshua Bloch. Same style of book, much higher timeliness.
NEGATIVE	"I purchased the item for my daughter. The ""guitar"" arrived broken, because of poor packing. I hope that the ""sender"" remembers to recontact us so we can get another one."
POSITIVE	"This is a great marketing book that helped me find a new direction for my business. This is a ""must read and keep"" bookfor financial professionals!"
NEGATIVE	Yes, the large size and programmable timer are convenient. No, the carafe doesn't keep the coffee hotter than cheaper models. Plus, it lacks a spout, which makes for messy pouring. Save your money. In this case, the name does NOT live up to the hype.
NEGATIVE	He wrote about 3 songs in the eighties that were alright, but he is just not good. I would not buy an entire album of his. There are much better artists out there that leave him in the dust.
NEGATIVE	This has almost nothing to do with the wonderful music you hear in the film. Unfortunately, Warner Bros. has seen fit to include mucho dialogue from the film over practically every piece of music on this CD. One of the worst (and could have been one of the best!) soundtracks ever.
NEGATIVE	"Caused ""Popping"" sound when playing any audio. Shorter cables are fantastic!Would recommend the shorter cables to everyone in the market for great quality speaker cables. Long length cables had serious problem. Perhaps a manufacturing defect?"
POSITIVE	The title says it all. BUT few people may realize that although we love horses, horses love us back many times more. Ann dose a fine job in her stories showing that it works both ways.
NEGATIVE	"The mechanism inside the step counter is ""loose"" so any movement adds steps. Also, the counter is on the side, as opposed to the top, and is difficult to read when you're wearing it. For the money - it's not worth a second look."
NEGATIVE	I clenched my teeth and somehow managed to endure the enternity of what was 79 minutes of horrible music. I can't imagine the band is proud of too much here!!!
NEGATIVE	So happy I only rented this garbage, only wish I could striken it from my memory. This has gotten to be about the worst movie I have seen this year. I would only watch this again if someone put a gun to my head.
NEGATIVE	I remember how happy I was when I bought this cd several years ago...and how disappointed I'd been afterwards. This cd is just pure crap. I could have never expected something so commercial and bad-written from who I considered (and I know I'm not the only one) the king of r'n'b.Apparently double-up is just as bad as this one, so I've never bought any cd from Robert again.This is really a waste, the guy used to be so talented!
POSITIVE	I am a fitness professional that every once in a while needs a butt kicking from someone other then me & this video delivered! Cathe and Amy Bento are two fitness professionals who release the beast!
NEGATIVE	"All the bad reviews are true!! I've been working with computers long enough to fix minor/major bugs. But this software qualifies as a VIRUS! Changes drive letters. Destroys OS. Bluescreen of death! You will have to reinstall your OS and lose all your data on your hard drive. So, unless you're a Republican, don't install this ""virusware""."
POSITIVE	If you love crosswords and puzzle games and New Yorker complexity in particular, don't be without this oversized NEW YORKER BOOK OF CARTOON PUZZLES AND GAMES. All you need is a pencil and a mind to enjoy puzzles which are offered in a spiral bound large-format paperback lending to easier working than most puzzle books. Here are over eighty puzzles created by the puzzle writing company Puzzability: new blends rather than rehashes of old styles. Avid puzzle fans will find it delightfully fun.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch
POSITIVE	If you are a Met fan you will enjoy this book. I knew this team was a wild bunch but I certainly learned a lot more about this team.
NEGATIVE	"Ouch!One previous reviewer said ""The author is a writer, not a designer.""That gave Mr. Lewinski too much credit as a writer.I've never seen so many passive, preposition-laden, cliché-ridden, hyperbole-loaded sentences!It really hurt my head to read this stuff.Despite the title, the book is not for Developers.Its title should have been:""A Total Beginner's Guide To Computer Game Design""..."
POSITIVE	Jessie and her friends get to go on a river rapid trip at the Grand Canyon. They all wate fot the guide to come but they neaver suspect that it is Troy.The first few rapids are easy and go by fast.They get to lava and Cristal to find out that they are rapids that are 10 out of 10 on the rapid chart. they get to the end adn have had a lot of fun on the trip.
POSITIVE	It's certainly a beautiful CD, with gorgeous music. But... I grew up with the music of Miriam Makeba on her older LP's, and quite frankly, her voice during the 60's and 70's was so exceptionally beautiful -- I truly think hers was one of the 2 or 3 greatest voices I've heard, up there with Ella -- that it's just not the same. Don't let me dissuade you from buying this CD, it's very, very good, and anyone who likes, traditional S. African music will *really* like this CD. But if you want to hear the real Makeba, with a voice so beautiful it sends a chill down your spine, you have to go to earlier materials. I hope the record companies release her early material some day.
NEGATIVE	I can confidently state that this is one of the worst albums ever put to tape.I mean who in their sanity would want to buy albums from a fake who does not write her own songs, brazenlylip synchs in front of millions and dresses up like a slut.Songs like I am a slave 4 you make me feel like throwing up in disgust.NO DONT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS CRAP.Get something nice like OBSCURED BY CLOUDS from PINK FLOYD instead.
POSITIVE	I am very happy with Amazon's service and I love my new GPS. The only problem, I'm still learning how to use all the features. Thank you.
NEGATIVE	This stuff taste like i was eating raw fish. Yes it's good for me but it's oh so nasty. I had to go back to my pills cuz I couldn't take it anymore.
NEGATIVE	About half way through the 1087 pages of the book I found myself thinking about the author as much as the characters. Where was the passion and mysticism of the times? Where were inspired and lofty thoughts arriving from middle ages faith? Perhaps the author does not believe in these things and couldnt imagine them.The plot and detail about the middle ages are interesting.But the wooden characters seem to reflect the amoral and secular people of our times and are cast backwards into the middle ages. This is Hollywood stuff.Perhaps the book was meant to be made into a film.
NEGATIVE	Just bought one for our almost 3 year old, partly so he would leave my guitars alone, but also so he could get a feel for a guitar that was more his size. But you can't properly tune this guitar, the neck is anything but straight so there is buzzing on every fret, basically, it's a toy. I guess this is what you get for 30 bucks. [...].
POSITIVE	This is a great hair iron. I have incredibly curly hair and I had tried straightening it with irons many times over the years only to end up with frizz. This thing really straightens my hair. I definately recommend it.
NEGATIVE	The structure of the characters were interesting. Less written would have been an improvement. Too much warm up. Author could have shortened the manuscript. I fell asleep reading this one. Better luck next time. A tint of Greek methology. Life in the 90's???? Give me the 20's to'59
POSITIVE	Fine product, just like all the other Lodge things. Wish it were just an inch or so bigger on the short side to give more coverage in a 10 inch skillet.Ah well.
POSITIVE	I bought this table to put my printer on. It's very nice and sturdy and was easy to put together. My printer paper fits nicely in the drawer.
POSITIVE	A great movie to watch. This movie reminds me ofErin Brockovichwhich is also a really good movie. I highly recommend this movie to people who care about our environment. After watching this movie, I started wondering if there are still places like this in our country, but don't hear about it.
NEGATIVE	2 weeks ago our laptop died and because I swore I'd never buy another Compaq again, we went with the Toshiba on the recommendation of our computer tech. BAD IDEA!! The first day we got it I was on the internet and the screen went black. I figured I must have hit something that set it in hibernation mode so I held down the power button until it shut down and restarted it again. A couple hours later, same thing...the next day, again and so on. I decided to do some research as I was planning on taking it in tomorrow to have it looked at. Well, after going on many websites, I have discovered this is happening all over the place. I am not the only one!!! I wish I had read these reviews before I bought mine.Needless to say, I am taking this laptop back tomorrow. I am not wasting my time with a company that KNOWS they are selling a product that is flawed and yet they continue to do so.Don't buy this computer, you will be sorry!!
NEGATIVE	This may be an amazing product- but it hurts like crazy. Basically an epilator is a machine with multiple rotating tweezers. You run the machine over your legs (or wherever) and the tweezer claws grab the hairs and pull them out. Some people may not be bothered by this, but I found it almost unbearable. I tried taking pain medication before using this and it didn't help much. It really hurts.Also, this machine is very noisy and makes a loud buzzing/grinding noise. I think that makes it even more intimidating.However the effects were GREAT on the parts I did complete. It lasts at least twice as long as shaving and is much less messy than waxing. Also, I think this Epilator is very well designed. I love the color and it is quite easy to clean.You have to have quite a bit of courage to use this, but if you do the results are great.
POSITIVE	Just finished installing this at my daughter's house. She has a fenced back yard, but the dog kept digging under it and she was afraid she would have to get rid of her. Since the dog is otherwise very sweet and a wonderful playmate for my 6-year-old granddaughter, I knew we had to do something to keep her. We installed the fence, not in the ground, but on the existing fence a few inches off the ground and looped back some 3 feet above that wire. To begin, I should have set the collar at level 3. Instead, I set it at 5 and gave the poor dog a really rough shock. I set it to 3 and she feels it but doesn't yelp like she's being tortured. At the moment, she is leery of going back outside, but I think she'll be ok as soon as she realizes she still has the rest of the yard to play in.
POSITIVE	I came across this book at the bookstore by chance and I am so glad i did. this book was so inspirational. whther it is surfing your into or not, you can apply the lessons behind it to anything. Bottom line: if you want to succeed, no one but yourself will get you there. No matter what the obstacles, if you have enough heart, soul, and guts, you can do anything.
POSITIVE	What a great product. I had family and friends recommend this product to me instead of using the furminator. The furminator was very rough on my German Shepherds. This product is wonderful. My pets absolutely love to be brushed with the Kong Zoom.
NEGATIVE	I am not pleasure with my purchase because, I bought a 8GB CF card and tha size of the card is 7.6 GB. That's make me doubt it is a real SanDick Card.
NEGATIVE	I'm a big fan of Disney movies, and sappy-ness doesn't bother me, but this was off the scales corny. Not much story, too much dancing around. Kind of chilidish for grownups and hard for kids to understand some of it, as it's mostly about politics, so it kind of gets lost in the middle. Buddy Ebsen, though, gives his usual stellar performance, and Kurt Russel and Goldie Hawn appear in the movie together and met on the set for the 1st time!
POSITIVE	I am a rather new Max Lucado fan but have already given 3 of these books as gifts. Lucado just has a way of making simple, non-judgemental sense out of the Bible and its teachings. As one who takes things TOO literally, I often never found the true meaning behind lots of Bible readings. Thanks, Max, for bridging the gap for me.
POSITIVE	I purchase the Elephant for my son and Frog for my daughter. They both enjoy the look of it in their rooms. It is small enough that I can put it on top of their furniture and not have to worry about ruining their expensive dresser. I enjoy the fact that there is no filter to replace. Filling them is extremely easy since it is so small it fits right in the bathroom sink.I did no give it five stars because when you lift the water tank to fill it water drips out of the bottom and if you flip it over out of the top. I just make sure I bring a towel with me when I am filling them so I can easy clean up any spills.I would still recomend any of the two I have.
POSITIVE	See the 'Hunters Specialties Push Pole Foot' for a real picture of this item.Bottom line, this item works great for its intended purpose.I used this item at the end of a cane walking stick for tromping in the swamps of southern NJ. A normal walking stick just sinks into the muck. This Marsh Foot did the trick, but with modifications:1) I cut the marsh foot in half since I didn't need such a big footprint for a walking stick2) I glued a neoprene booty over the top of the marsh foot so it wouldn't snag on roots when the walking stick was pulled back up from the muck.The neoprene booty had the additional advantage of protecting my leg against the sharp edges of the marsh foot during normal walking / hiking.
POSITIVE	I am a Physical Therapist and order another brand from the medical supply company for a lot more than the cost of this lift. This lift works great and is very durable.
POSITIVE	Good behind the scenes interviews - just wish that it had some filming bloopers. I appreciate the fact how the development of the show really makes the show come alive. It also gives greater appreciation for the show. Can't wait for future seasons to be released.
NEGATIVE	"Update of 05/20/2012:The photo on Amazon features the ""New Taste"" Catalina product (carefully examine the label), yet the title line for the product includes the word ""Classic"" in the product available from the 'Ozbo' supplier. Be very careful about what you buy. Some time ago, Kraft finally relented and brought back the 'classic' Catalina after lots of negative commentary about its ""New Taste"" Catalina formula.My Previous Entry:I purchased a bottle of 'new' Catalina dressing at our local supermarket to try it out. What a disaster! DO NOT purchase this 'new taste' product if you are expecting the traditional Catalina dressing."
NEGATIVE	I just couldn't get past the taste of this toothpaste. It basically tasted like baking soda with just a little hint of the mint. I really didn't care for the way it made my teeth feel afterwards either. I'm sure it's because it's all natural, but I think I'll stick with my normal brand.
POSITIVE	"I bought this hair dryer for a rental condo in a ""chic"" downtown community and it fits RIGHT in !"
NEGATIVE	Matthew Stadler proved with no doubt that he is a superb craftsman in _Landscape: Memory_. But _Sex Offender_'s pedophilia theme overwhelmed his craftsmanship, and here, _Allan Stein_ is more of the same. I think Mr. Stadler is a wonderful writer, but if he could write about grown up men together, he'd be a lot more readable to me personally.
NEGATIVE	Maximo SAN-360 Car FM Transmitter & Charger For Sansa e200 c200 c100 MP3 PlayersThe Maximo SAN-360 transmits an large amount static on very station I tried to use as a carrier. Consider another option.
NEGATIVE	I found this book to be bogged down in details and lacking in movement. The characters are too quirky and overstyled to feel real. Overall, the book seems self-indulgent and therefore does not speak to the reader. It has nice moments, but feels more like an exercise in writing rather than a piece that comes from the heart.
POSITIVE	These are my favorite bearings to buy when I need to replace my old ones. They aren't too expensive either.
NEGATIVE	I guess to just come out and yell THIS MOVIE SUCKED BIG TIME would be rude.Hmmmm.... (She is desperately trying to find something nice to say about this total waste of film.) Ok. At least we have two great actors in Nicholson and Bates who were obviously suckered, blackmailed, or otherwised talked into doing a really boring movie. Nothing was a surprise, you didn't like Nicholson's character, and quite honestly, who cared if he decided to put us and his movie family our of our respective miserys by running the RV over the nearest bridge.The critics loved this movie and I haven't a clue why. BORING BORING BORING is about all I can say about it.Anything Nicholson and Bates have done is better than this stinker. Borrow or rent them instead.
POSITIVE	Safari no problems. Color true to photo. Nice sturdy rug. Looks great in a brown , black or even white room. Delivery was quick with no damage.
POSITIVE	If you don't already have this CD, you should sample it. I am not going to tell to buy it because if you just listen to it, you will want a copy. This is really great music. David's enthusiasm for the pieces is felt throughout the CD.I did want to raise a philosophical question though. Was the music inspiring David to play this way or did David transform the music into something larger than the sum of its parts? Even though you can hear David playing, you cannot help but wonder if there is some larger Christmas spirit at work, reminding us that the holidays are about giving and how we should love one another.In any event, way to go David!
NEGATIVE	When I first received this CD in the mail, I had very high hopes. I had the stereo Mercury LPs which these titles first appeared on. However, over the years they wore out and I was looking to replace some of the songs with digital copies. When I finally put this CD in my player, to say I was extremely disappointed would be an understatement. This has got to be, without a doubt, the most horrendous attempt at mastering for CD release I have EVER encountered. The folks who put this out should be ashamed of themselves!! What a way to treat one of the truly great stylists in the history of country music!! A real shame- -and a sham!!
NEGATIVE	I watched this film because it was recommended along with Y Tu Mama Tambien. As much as it is bad to compare, Sex and Lucia doesn't even come far second to Y Tu Mama Tambien. The only credit I will have to give this movie is its cinematography and music score. The movie was altogether tiring and the sex scenes were too graphic to start with. I don't understand why the characters have to bare all! (as in everything in many times)Another thing I observed in this movie was that the lighting was too bright that it is very difficult for us foreign enthusiast to read the subtitles. The light was very much glaring to the eyes. I didn't like it.Over-all, I would only recommend this film to people who loves sex scenes inserted in an o-k story. But if you're looking for a quality sex-oriented film, this is not what you're looking for.
NEGATIVE	There was very little, if any, substance to this book. Pages are filled with large screen shots of self-evident, follow-the-menu tasks. It was a total waste of money.
NEGATIVE	This is supposed to be a begginers course in Japanese and so why many of the vocabulary words are written in Kanji and not just Hiragana or Katakana is beyond me. In Japan the natives themselves do not bother with Kanji untill around intermediate school so this really pissed me off.
NEGATIVE	I am not judging the content but the translation. The translation is extremely poor. It is full of typographical errors and has not been proofread. I notice that the name of the translator is not on the cover. I am not surprised. I would not wish mine to appear either if I were responsible for it. Literary translation is an art this is very pedestrian. I started to read the book but then decided to read it in the original and recycle this sorry effort.
POSITIVE	I know a reader-review should respond to the book itself, and not the comments of the other reviewers, but this recent batch of negative reviews are so wildly off the mark that they beg correction. I don't know what these readers are thinking, but it seems to me like they either haven't read 'Musca Domestica' or simply lack the faculties to read it fairly.In any case, potential buyers, don't be discouraged by these nonsensical reviews. 'Musca Domestica' is an incredibly rewarding book: the poems are only difficult in the way that the most intriguing and beautiful puzzles are difficult. These poems reward in every way: Ms. Hume manages to be funny and poignant and provoactive and weird all at once, and the more time you spend with this book the more delightful it becomes.Give 'Musca Domestica' a try -- the poems have earned it, and the book will richly repay your attention!And to you 'readers' in the one-star crowd: snap out of it, kids.
POSITIVE	This is the best Christmas movie of all time. My family and I watch this over and over during Christmas and even during the off season just to get a lift.
NEGATIVE	I was not happy with this keyboard for one reason...reflective paint on the keys. If the keyboard was used in a completely dark room, it would work great, but the light from my monitor reflects off of the keys, resulting in a very low contrast between the keys and the illuminated letters on the keys. The tops of the keys should have been painted with a matte, non-reflective black, so that the blue light shining through the letters would be more in contrast. In real life use, the visual ergonomics are very poor.I think this keyboard is a great concept, but it was poorly realized. The light from a monitor reflects off of the keys, creating almost a silver look which is very low contrast to the illumination color.I also purchased a small Zippy Illuminated keyboard which is much easier to read. However, the Zippy is only slightly larger than a laptop keyboard and I wanted a full size, so I ordered the Eclipse.
NEGATIVE	"I bought this for my Dad so that my Mom could watch television with him at a normal level while he can turn up the volume on the headset as loud as he wants. So far he hasn't been able to use it. He called the number for help that was in the instructions. That rep gave him another number. Then the second rep gave him a third number to call. Then the third rep told him to ""go online"". My Dad is 74; he does not go online. So Sony has been no help. I live far away, so I can't look at the setup myself. I asked him questions, went online to find answers, asked him more questions. Finally figured out one of the problems is that the cable to connect the unit to his television is too large for the TV's line out, which is where it has to connect in order for both of my parents to hear the TV. Does anyone know if there is an adapter available? I dread calling Sony for this because I don't have all day to be on the phone."
POSITIVE	"I saw this movie on TV many times as a child, and everytime I saw it I would cry at the end. I have read other reviews about how the movie is dated and ""politically incorrect"", c'mon people this movie was made decades ago, and for it's time, it was and is dynamite, I will always remember the scene at the end where, the maid has literally died of a broken heart,'cause her daughter has rejected her. There is a funeral procession led by beautiful white horses, and Mahalia Jackson is singing at the Funeral , and the Maid's daughter running behind the funeral procession, screaming ""Mama, I'm sorry!"". This movie is my absolute all time favorite."
POSITIVE	i have always liked steppenwolf since the late 60's. it brings back to me so many memories of where i was at the time, the loves of my life, as well as what i was doing. rock me baby all night long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
POSITIVE	Inspiring story of the life of Glenn Wesley Turner, an 8th grade dropout who lost a fortune three times in ten years, then went on to turn $5,000 into over a quarter of a billion, was a victim of government abuse and still came back...
NEGATIVE	I had high hopes for this, but it was bad. Really bad. The whole pan of cupcakes made from this had to be thrown out. Very gritty and dense.
POSITIVE	I bought the brown guitar strap. What was delivered was much darker than what is shown in here. I wanted a lighter one just as shown. Anyway, this strap is good. Cannot return the item as I am outside the US.
NEGATIVE	"Gosh. Cecil Adams has been answering inane, lewd, bizarre, and downright puzzling questions for over 30 years in his column ""The Straight Dope.""Why do men have nipples, you ask? Cecil took that one on May 18, 1979. He's taken on enough to write 5 books worth, in fact.Just giving credit where it's due. Forget this book and head to www.straightdope.com."
NEGATIVE	This dvd that millions of people spent their money on was NOT FUNNY AT ALL..... Kevin hart has fell off or this is just a miss..but I never that he was funny in the first place...i guess we have to say it was good cause it was kevin hart...people dont want to keep hearing about your kids and repeating the same check joke about 6 times.. it ended terrible and the skits were bad as well.. once the money comes some people lose their focus
POSITIVE	Looks sturdy and comfortable, a little bit bulkier that expected. Did not have chance to use it in public though - we just started potty training.
NEGATIVE	When you buy from Tiger Direct, if you find the item just doesn't work with your computer (but may work with some other computer that you don't have), then you are stuck. Unless the manufacturer agrees that the item you bought is defective (meaning it doesn't work at all for anyone), no refund.So I suggest not buying this mouse from Tiger Direct. As you can see from the feedback, for many people it just doesn't work. It doesn't mean it is defective necessarily, because perhaps it works with some computers. But Dell laptops seem to have an especially hard time remaining paired with it, making it useless to me. Badly designed not to work more generally, and a bad seller for not accepting returns.
NEGATIVE	My wife recently read this book and became offended over Mr. Rallo's listing of Roman Catholicism's belief in the Real Presence as a stronghold to be prayed against. Mr. Rallo could well be enlightened and educated about the Roman Catholic faith by a reading of the Catchecism of the Catholic Church.
POSITIVE	This CD is great, even though its not as good as ghetto d. all those no limit haters are just jealous that the tang doggs are taking over the rap scene! can't wait for 504 boyz to come out...
NEGATIVE	Had good success with this product in the past. This last pack was a dud. At least 20% of these disc's are bad and will not take a recording. Tried to complain to their customer service. When I finally got a name and number their contact person (Ms Marty Lang) never bothered to get back to me.
POSITIVE	"I absolutely HATE working out, but this DVD is actually fun for me! I am not at all coordinated, so I know I don't look like the ""Island Girl"" in the video, but as long as no one sees me, I love doing this workout!"
NEGATIVE	"This movie is so cheap, sickening, offensive, racist, tacky, and without merits that it gives bad movies new standards for comparison. It's not even sexy. Possibly the worst movie ever seen and the only VHS that I've bought that has been sent directly to the trash can! Trust me, do not waste your money. Buy ""Billy Hollywood's Screen Kiss"". At least, you won't get sick! One star is given because there are no lower standards given. Take one star as a far fetched compliment!"
NEGATIVE	Not who I thought they were - their style is beyound my taste, so I will drop it off at the kitchen counter at work for someone esle to 'enjoy'
NEGATIVE	I totally concur with the previous reviewer that this is a very disappointing book. The main reason I write another negative review is because apart from loving Borges' books, I also love crime and mystery novels. I always have a Borges book on the go; reading and rereading his fictions, poems and essays. Despite that I was extremely bored by this book. As a matter of fact I had great difficulty reading more than a few pages at a time as it was sending me to sleep every time. This is parody as it is signaled by the title, which for some reason is not given fully by amazon; the full title is Six Problems for Don Isidro Parodi. Perhaps the parody can be appreciated by those who know Argentine events and culture in the 40s but if so, such in-jokes were lost to me.
NEGATIVE	I started this book but I could not finish it due to the foul language. It was very disappointing. I understand a little language but this was over the top.
POSITIVE	These batteries last just as long as the Duracell batteries I have bought from the brick and mortar store. I would definitely buy them again from Amazon, as long as the price is right. Make sure you stick with Amazon as the seller. Other vendors are allowed to sell on Amazon and usually when a product has a bad review for being counterfeit, expired, or poorly packaged it was not sold by Amazon. It lists the seller a couple of lines under the price on the product page.
NEGATIVE	Its just another dull, well produced album in the creative cesspool that is hip-hop at the moment. Yeah there's some clever rhyming and some well crafted hooks, but in general it's just same ol, same ol'.
POSITIVE	Loved this cd. If you have heard CJ's first few albums and enjoyed them you will definately enjoy this. I recommend this for any CJ fan.
POSITIVE	Skellig was a really great great book. It was about friendship and love. This was my favorite book because Michal was kind and made a friend named Mina. Skellig was a man who lived in Michal's garage,ate dead blue bottles. Dead blue bottles are dead bugs.He also ate 27 and 53. But it never tells what these numbers are,but mabey if you read this yourself you could find out.Skellig also was very weak so he couldn't move. I love this book and if you read it I hope you love it to. In the end somthing great really happens but I can't tell youy so read it.From a dedacated reader.
NEGATIVE	I expected more from this book. It is basically a non-technical review of composition for the beginner. The photos are really great, but they don't list the usual information used to get them (lens type, settings, filters, etc.). I really didn't gain any insight from this book, and doubt that anyone other than a beginning photographer would either.For landscape photography, and for photography in general, their basic photography guide is much better.
NEGATIVE	"I'm a huge consumer of sardines and decided to order these since they received good reviews. They pale in comparison to the fresh-taste and soft-texture of Wild Planet brand sardines. Those also come with lots of liquid/oil etc in the can which happens to be BPA-free. These are dry and pasty and have very little fluid in the can. Also, I followed the link here from the Crown Prince website which advertises these as being packed in BPA-free cans. However, when they arrived I realized they weren't. I contacted Crown Prince about this and they basically said that amazon is selling an older stock in BPA-coated cans. I'm annoyed that they'd place a link on their site to ""order now from amazon"" and then when you order it is not the product advertised on their website. In my opinion, that is a very poor response from the company."
NEGATIVE	Wonder, does this DVD have the closed caption or subtitles (in English, of course)???I know some of you don't care but I DO!!!!!!! Why?! Because I am deaf and been fan of KISS for nearly 25 years.
NEGATIVE	songs like Love will keep us together were alright 20 years back.but for the most part the music of Captain&Tennille is very dated and Lounge Material at best.a more Sopisticated duo than Sonny&CHer.catchy but forgettable as well.
POSITIVE	This is a great CD for anyone who is a pop fan. 6 Piece is a group of friends from the Atlanta area. These are great guys with incredible voices. And I should know I was one of their many fans who helped support them from the very beginning. Viva la 6Piece. Love you guys!!!
POSITIVE	The Fall of Berlin was a good read as I was interested in more detail about the final chapter of World War II. It gave me an insight into the workings of the Red Army and the massive revenge it wreaked on Germany as a whole. The end of the Nazi state and the fall of Berlin were a truly violent events, as had been the German invasion on the Eastern Front in 1941.
NEGATIVE	I am an avid viewer of Sex and The City and I truly enjoy the storylines. I was hoping to enjoy this book as much as I enjoy the show. Unfortunately, this was the most unsatisfying book I have ever read. The characters were completely unlikable and the book left you wondering if there was any purpose of their stories being told. The author stopped writing about each of them in the middle of their story and never went back to explain a thing. This was an absolute waste of time and money.
NEGATIVE	I like so much Cirque du Soleil (CdS) Shows. This is the first DdS Show that I feel that is very slow, in fact my children who love Cirque du Soleil were bored. The performances are not as amazing as other performances in other Cirque du Soleil shows (for instance VAREKAI).
NEGATIVE	Gave this to a friend as a gift. When they got to Season 2-Disc 3, it would not work. Very embarrasing.
POSITIVE	This 1991 concert is excellent with the best lineup since the original band (69-71) were all around and making great music. Warren Haynes makes for an excellent 2nd lead guitar with Dickey Betts and the band plays many of their classic tunes including extended versions of Elizabeth Reed and Jessica. don't buy the dvd as the editing is awful - but do get the vhs for all the uncut tunes.
POSITIVE	This is the 3rd book I've read by Jessica Hagedorn. Her writing is amazing!The characters in Dream Jungle are well developed... The subject matter and themes discussed are also well written and developed and edgy. Dream Jungle is a fun, fast, gritty page turner! Once you begin reading this novel it is difficult to put down as you want to find out what happens next.
POSITIVE	It didn't take me long to figure the author was from the South. It painted a southern paradise that was destroyed by the North. However, I did enjoy the story line itself.
POSITIVE	This router works flawless. I would have given it 5 stars, but I had trouble getting the WAN to work. The solution was written by a Jack Szwergold. I was about to return this product until I found Jack Szwergold's post. I wasted 3 hours of my time trying to troubleshoot. Thanks Jack Szwergold.I would recommend this product. Read the Jack Szwergold's post if you have cable broadband.
POSITIVE	This CD was the hit of the party. Everyone was singing and dancing to these songs. These songs were golden oldies and everyone asked me where I bought it. All these songs are by the original artists. Great party record.
NEGATIVE	Katherine Harris is a good, honest, God-fearing woman, who did exactly the right thing in the 2000 election, and this awful man should be deported for writing this book! It is bad enough to make fun of the Bush brothers like he does, but then to ridicule poor Katherine, too? It made me sick, to read it, just as it made me sick to read the liberal media's attempts to discredit the Bushes and Mrs. Harris over the last two years. I couldn't even finish it. Think about it: If not for Katherine Harris, Al Gore would be President today! Is that what anyone wants? Please do not buy this book and encourage this man. If you want to read a GOOD book, you should read Center of the Storm: Practicing Principled Leadership in Times of Crisis, by Katherine Harris.
NEGATIVE	A test of your gullibility, a testament of gullibility.This story is an elaboration of typical spiritual snake oil.Here's the summary:Person can't cope, tries traditional remedies, they don't help.Looks around for a guru and, big surprise, finds one.Guru sends self absorbed person on a quest, with vague instructions, such that, no matter what happens, the guru looks wise.Seeker endures a lifestyle change, and some discomfort, and eyes are `opened' to the `truth.'Now seeker is qualified to be your guru, cycle continues.If you want to read first person pronouns, I and me, until you choke, this is the book for you.If you want to believe a ridiculous tale of drug induced delusion, silly rituals (like rubbing an egg over your body to remove toxins) this is the book for you.If you are weary of childish voodoo, skip it.If it was possible, I would rate it no stars, but Amazon doesn't allow that choice.
NEGATIVE	What To Expect When Expecting was good info for being pregnant the first time. However, when I found out I was pregnant, I felt confident that I could be a good mother. By the time I had read What To Expect The 1st Year, I felt like a paranoid idiot. NOT ALL BABIES ARE THE SAME!!! In this day and age of EXPERTS on everything, I think we need to remember who the experts are here--the MOTHERS. We know our kids better than anyone. I went and bought Dr. Spock's revised ed. The first sentence is TRUST YOURSELF. I don't feel like such an idiot anymore. Not all babies start on solids at 4mo or can put themselves to sleep, or want juice, etc. Only mothers know what their babies need.
POSITIVE	"Kell Bell! You did it again! Absolutely Flawless. Taken from the Grammy winning album Breakaway, Kelly tells you to walk off her if you don't know what you want. Chosen as the fifth and final single from the album, it keeps climbing the charts. Remixes are always superb with the right touch. After seeing her live twice, this is the best beginning girl anthem of 2006! Be sure to preview remixes! If you like this single, I also recommend the import singles Since U Been Gone, Behind These Hazel Eyes, and Because of You here at Amazon! Go ahead ""Walk Away"" with this cd!"
NEGATIVE	Not for people who want to shape their bodies! This is more of a performance dance dvd. Tanna is not a good instructor and production values are not very good, either. And why have an introduction by a fitness instructor if you made a dance dvd? I was disappointed in this workout because it is not even on each side of the body, the moves are vague, the instructor mumbles. I did like the mirror- this helped me see better how to perform the moves. I felt as if I should already know how to belly dance; perhaps that is the target audience? I will stick to Rania's workout dvd's with a belly dance 'flavour', at least I can work up a sweat. And what is all this palaver with the fabric and the cane? I thought they were optional, but they are central to the dance.
POSITIVE	I am 14 years old and read Of Mice and Men for my 8th grade literature class. I usually don't like sad books, but this is DEFINITELY an exception. This is a tragic tale of friendship, love, and sacrafice, and I am crying just thinking about the end. Steinbeck tells life as it was in the '30s, never making life perfect and easy. My class and I watched the movie in class, and no one had dry eyes at the end. This book is not to be missed by anyone.
POSITIVE	"Unashamed&#8213;Rahab""A woman with a past to whom God gave a future.""Her father needed money. He wanted prestige and acceptance. Their was one way to achieve it, and Rahab was her father's clear path. He offers her to Jericho's king. But Rahab plans her escape, and finally, she offers the king something he can't resist.The Israelites are marching onward, their sights on Jericho. Many have heard of their God's power and quake in fear of what the Israelites will do when they reach their city. Even with their tall walls, trained army, and military strategy, Jericho is no different.Rahab is curious when she hears of Israel's God, and even more so when something mystifying enters the gates of Jericho. She begins to wonder if a God, who held so much power, could accept a person with scarlet staining her past. And if a nation could receive her for not who she had been, but who she had become."
POSITIVE	I have had this DVD now for about five months and have finally decided to write a review on it based on all the negative comments about it swirling around.NO, this is not pure yoga - you will not feel spiritual about it, however, if you give it a chance, you will feel and see that you have gotten a great workout from it. The moves are fun, and yes, the cueing by Denise is not great, but like any other workout video you have to do it a couple of times before you feel into the groove with it. I find her chatty style charming and motivating at first - but when I know the moves and can push and concetrate even harder by myself, I can block it out.BELIEVE ME, if you really do it right, you WILL see a difference in your backside and your legs.. I would highly recommend trying this - After using this a couple of times a week at first, I now work it in about once a week to throw in some variety... I highly recommend this!!
NEGATIVE	Why I have to give credit to Christopher for experimenting with multiple points of view, he didn't pull it off successfully. Most of Eragon's story was dull description of the elves' home (which reminded me heavily of descriptions from LoTR) while Nasuada's was too short and came off as a cheap way to show the audience what was happening to the Varden. With the exception of a couple chapters, Roran's pov was the more interesting of the three because he actually did some important things during it. The pacing was overall a bit long as well and some parts felt like they could have benefited from more editing. I truthfully preferred Eragon over this book.
NEGATIVE	Buy this album its has a lot of good songs. He should have colloabrated with Britney Spears cause she is a great lyricist just like 50 cent. 50 cent is the best rapper in the whole world he should get a grammy for this album. He is better then any rapper alive and he is a tough guy Yeah buy this
POSITIVE	This novel is an easy read. The incredible lives of these four friends will enthral you. You'll want to send a copy to every girlfriend. A MUST READ!
NEGATIVE	It is a very cute set. My grandaughter used the toaster one time and you could hear the part break off inside the toaster...needless to say we where both very upset. If you just want to look at it on a shelf..it's great. If you actually want to play with it..well...I would not buy this product.
POSITIVE	I initially gave these bowls only a couple of stars because I thought the handles were too short and got too hot. But since using them for a while, I love them. I just grab the handle with a damp dish rag and the problem is solved. They are great. Get them !
POSITIVE	I love The Regan Reily Mystery Series written by Carol Higgins Clark. The are funny mysterious and easy to read. It is great when Regan gets into things and figures it out what happened.
NEGATIVE	Love the Chameleons. Great melodic music. I was very much looking forward to this CD. One big problem, the mastering (sound quality and range) is by far the worst that I have listened to in years. Tried listening to this CD twice. Pathetic. Tossed it in my junk box in the closet. Oh well.PS: I spent over 3K for my car system and at home I have a bi-amped very good system as well, so it was not my sound systems.
NEGATIVE	I thought this would be great, but as it turns out the idea of the product was better than actuality. If you do purchase, be sure to cook on a lower temp and longer than what your directions call for. Also, use a smaller amout of grease to coat.
NEGATIVE	I bought this book. I read it. I learned nothing. I just wasted my time for this BS book. Save your moneys. I tossed this book to the garbage instead of recycling or donating to the library because it is really suck! ...
POSITIVE	I purchased the Accutape twenty years ago and I am ordering a new one today.After twenty years it is no longer working. Pretty good value for the money.This device has helped me measure thousands of apartments and houses during my career as a Realtor.It helped me look professional and my customerswere impressed with how I measure the rooms so quickly.This is definitely a must for all Realtors
NEGATIVE	I purchased these headphones becuase they were rated as good for working out and running. I do not agree. They have great sound, however the cord is too short and the extention piece knocks around when you run with them. I wear my ipod attached to my shorts, so the cord needs to be long enough to reach my waist from my ears. These are NOT the headphones for this purpose.
NEGATIVE	great alarm clock. no battery!!?didn't realize until i gave it as a gift to my dad. He didn't want to hurt my feelings and left it in the office as a clock. Next year, i get his computer UPS so he can use the alarm clock.If your power ever went out, NOT WORTH IT
NEGATIVE	I Respect Nelson George from way back when, but this Book doesn't really do much for Me one way or the other.as for Russell Simmons I respect the fact He made His Way but overall I don't find Him that Challenging&I can't Respect How He let His Artists kinda just slip without taking care of them Better.Public Enemy,LL COOL J to name a few didn't get the best shake from Him.He gets into His Lifestyle&that's basically it.nothing more nothing less.Very Ordinary read.
NEGATIVE	I owned the predecesssor to this model which was a 12 volt rechargable which hung on the wall in its recharger. the plastic impeller came apart (bad plastic or design) and tried to buy the part. I couldn't do it so I bought this 18 volt cordless model. it has considerably less power than the 12 volt, which had a battery about twice the size of the 18.volt. I will grant it is a benefit that the 18 volt has a removable battery so I can change batteries when one runs down but even when the battery is fresh, it does not blow as hard as the old model. Only consider this machine if you have a small area to do and nothing very heavy to blow.
NEGATIVE	These are decent lights for navigating the woods in the dark, but if you do...get two of them. They like to cut out often, requiring a sharp rap to get working again...then they work just fine for a bit...and repeat the entire scenario all over again. It is as though the contacts are inferior and unable to provide a constant load to the LED bulb.Why do they send more of those stupid nylon sheaths? I have to have at least twenty of them now over the years, and have yet to actually find any use for any of them.On a positive note, they are plenty bright, and the batteries last quite a while, if they would just always work as they should, they would be great...but they just plain do not...not at all dependable.
POSITIVE	I am very pleased with the quality, efficiency, and also the price of the CA-53 cables I ordered from Amazon. I would not hesitate to order other products in the future.
NEGATIVE	"Taken from the 8th Amendment- ""nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted,"" the title better describes the tormenting of truth with which Mr. Miller's polemical polygot is replete then it does his imaginary Bushian tyrany. The left wingnuts here will no doubt wax ecstatic over the typical liberal name-calling, and Amazon will no doubt strictly enforce its rules against any use of such by right wing critics of this latest bit if filth from Miller. A last thought, the libs wentover the past few days crazy attacking their erstwhile hatchet man Zell. Will they object to we conservatives savaging this Miller?"
NEGATIVE	One needs only to ready the first few pages of this book to learn what lies in store for the reader - a whiny and consistently backbiting deconstruction (or at least an attempt at it) of the US government and international policies.Unfortunately, I didn't stop after just the first few pages, but powered on to the end. It's not that the materials or concept of finding faults with the US foreign policy is bad - it's that this book is. It's delivery is terrible and the agenda of the writer is clear.There are better books for histories of US foreign policy & actions & snapshots of current affairs and how things need to change.
POSITIVE	LaPlante does a wonderful job of bringing her ancestor to life through the court transcripts, but also by bringing to life the world that she lived in. She gives thorough biographies of not just Anne, but her father and her accusers. By giving the reader an understanding of all the players in this drama, Anne's tale is even more powerful. Toward the end of her hearing, you almost want to put your hand over Anne's mouth to stop her lambast of her judges, but at the same time you can't help admiring her courage. The solidity of the early pages dwindles off toward the end, through no fault of LaPlante, because of the paucity of records regarding Anne's last years, we can only get a sketchy outline of her exile. That outline feels like even less because of the fully fleshed out Anne of early in the book.
NEGATIVE	"Indeed, it is an ""all can do"" machine. At least during the first months. We are a small business and use the machine only a few times a day. But after a few months we had a problem with ink lines being spread out on each page we printed out. The Brother people (help line) were very helpful but couldn't find a solution. I eventually came up with the idea to replace the Drum Unit. The problem was solved but two weeks later, we had the same problem all over again. Now I wouldn't mind that this Drum Unit was just a few bucks...the problem is that one of these Drum Units costs you A LOT MORE than the purchase price of the Brother MFC-4800. ............In a perfect world, you can take it to a service center that Brother suggests. But who can live without a fax, telephone and copier for a week? Not a normal business! !! Do yourself a favour, calculate your time, toner and drum unit costs into the price of a machine.A more expensive one might actually be cheaper in the long run."
POSITIVE	The contents of this book are still relevant today even though it was published 4 years ago. Google hasn't change enough to make the examples obsolete. After working through the book I was able to create standard searches that helped me find sensitive information posted on a company web site and on 3rd party web sites. I've used what I learned in this book during penetration tests as well. I would recommend it for both auditors and penetration testers.
NEGATIVE	"It is refreshing to see A. N Wilson trying to take a somewhat critical view of the ""C. S. Lewis industry"" as he calls it. He attempts to make some controversial new highlights but to my mind he does not quite make it. He has a lot of information here but it is not put together more convincingly than the books written by the fans of the Narnia man. As he was a professor at Cambridge I think there are plenty of people who would have ""blown the whistle"" if he as many dodgy things as ANW makes out. And - it's just occurred to me - who is ANW to criticise the CSL industry? he is part of it too now..."
POSITIVE	It took my cats a couple of days to decide that they would drink out of this. I think the noise scared them a bit. There is a humming sound tha tyou hear, after awhile you do not even notice it.
NEGATIVE	Here's what the one star is for: I liked tracking my baby's development month by month. It was nice to know what was growing, what was new, what she could do each month. Other than that, it was useless. The worst thing about this book is that it tells the reader that they cannot trust their own intuition but instead to take their physician's word as gospel. Instead of providing calm advice about things that might be going on of concern during a woman's pregnancy, it tells you to run to your doctor. The message this book sends it that everything is something to worry about and women shouldn't be trusted to know their bodies well enough to have an opinion. Ladies, DON'T READ THIS BOOK! Get Ina May's Guide to Childbirth for a far more realistic book that looks out for the woman rather than the medical industry.
POSITIVE	Hors D'oeuvresThe Hors D'oeuvres in this book are fabulous and very easy. All my guest love the Hors D'oeuvres that I have made from this book. You will love it too!
POSITIVE	This is a great classic movie. The acting is superb. And it has reference to Nazi Germany, a meaningful allegory.
POSITIVE	I am a recent college graduate who found myself not making much money and worrying about my future, until I was given The Unofficial Guide to Real Estate Investing as a gift. Martin Stone and Spencer Strauss have cut through all the red tape and put my fears of investing, to rest. The book is easy to read and easy to understand. They answered most of my questions in the book, but even more, responded to some bigger questions via e-mail. Anyone who doesnt have this book, and is looking to live a little bit easier life, needs to run out and get it right now.
NEGATIVE	what speed does it connect to the internet at please?2MB per second its a parallel modem how is it governed by the speed of the serial uart please?why are there no youtube videos of fone modems connecting to the internet pleaseonly one customer per product set is allowed no really amazon and what does that mean in english exactly that the fone modem can t work at the speed it was manufactured to work at otherwise the morons wont pay more money for broadband?
NEGATIVE	Shrek 3 is a sad, empty chapter in the Shrek saga. The jokes are flat, the pop culture references are forced, and the big play finale made me squirm in agony. The first movie was brilliant but this one shows that writers are running on empty. Graphically it's a beautiful movie but the movie seems forced to make as much money as possible. The writers clearly needed another year or two to develop the story. Ratatoui and Surf's Up were vastly superior to this movie. Even my daughter hated this movie.
NEGATIVE	we ordered and received two of the Wagan Brite-Nite Spotlights. After only one month, one of the lights quit working. Both were charged per the instructions and appeared to be good. Would not recommend these lights to anyone!!
NEGATIVE	What bothers me about most of the reviews of books on Amazon is that they are written by staff of some publishing houses, whether for or against the book. They are mostly not written by readers. Just look at the time and effort put into writing some reviews.Ciao
POSITIVE	I have yet to read a book on Miles Davis that I didn't like.this Book is Incredible very fully Writing.it deals with his Music his Life and Surroundings as A Man.the Great thing about this Book is that it sticks to the music and that's the most Important Aspect when Talking About A Genius As Important As Miles Davis.
NEGATIVE	Robert Downey looks great (nice shirts, Sherlock), but he swallows most of his hastily delivered lines and is often incomprehensible. My wife and I would turn to each other laughing after he'd spoken and then exchange gibberish in imitation of the vocally impaired detective. (I suspect that Downey, insecure about his British accent, decided to enfog most of what he was forced by the script to say.)Lord Blackstone emerges as the hero if only because he's about the only significant (male) character whose lines can be comprehended. Bring him back! In fact, give him his own franchise (and it's hard to believe this Sherlock will become one).
POSITIVE	Johnny Depp is such amazing actor!... I love this movie so much more than the original willy wonka!... thanks for getting this to me sooner than expected!
POSITIVE	I absolutely LOVE cafe del mar classic series. I have them all. Sadly they don't have new album anymore!Such a good collection of relaxing classic music! Is there any other similar album like this?
POSITIVE	I love Maynard anyway. So, no matter if it's Tool or A Perfect Circle, I'm pretty much sold. I do like Undertow. However, 10,000 Days is my ultimate favorite Tool CD.
POSITIVE	This was a great movie with a good plot and the actors played their roles well. People ranted andraved on how scary it was leaving me wanting to see it in the theater but i could not, and so bought it for DVD when it came out. I was expecting an all out terrifying movie but i was wrong and misled. It was not scary it all, it had it's moments but The Exorcist would take it any day. If u want some suspense, a good story line and a movie that never over stays it's welcome watch it.
POSITIVE	I've been using this for a few weeks and it works really well - the head pivots and everything. My only complaint would be that the blades seem to be really fine and it takes me a little while to do my whole face. But not a big deal.
NEGATIVE	Disappointed. Title is great, but content is lacking. Mostly an excruciating recap of some notable maritime tragedies rather than a discussion of the issues associated with governance of the seas, UNCLOS, inability of coastal states to manage their coastlines, flags of convenience, etc.
NEGATIVE	Do not get this game! First of all you don't get to go on the good rides. Someone who thought of this game is really dumb. I really would give it a 0 but you can't put 0. It takes to long to go on the ride. All you do mostly is pit up trash. Don't be fooled by this game cover. I'm worring you DON'T GET THIS GAME.
POSITIVE	This blanket is super soft & very warm. It took a little bit to get it, but was worth the wait.
NEGATIVE	"For the mostpart, this is not a collection of Grace Slick's solo works, it's yet another reissue of stuff that's already out there. Very little of it is from ""Manhole"", ""Dreams"", ""Welcome to the Wrecking Ball,"" and ""Software."" I'm very disappointed! Would somebody please issue these four albums on CD?"
POSITIVE	Jim Roper has done a wonderful job of getting out some of the incredible stories of missions flown by our pilots in the secret war in Laos. Having flown those missions myself as a Covey FAC, 1968-69, I can vouch for the authenticity of his book. I for one highly recommend his book.A fellow Covey FAC and former Raven, Larry Ratts, sent me the paperback copy and I,m now ordering the hardcover version for my library.Thanks Jim for writing the book and Larry for the gift of the bookDon Fulton / Covey 538
POSITIVE	I believe that music is the universal language and that the Lord God Almighty made it so that in times of tragedy and travail we have an outlet to lift up our voices to be heard and He does and is quick to respond. In times of gladness a joyful noise is '...a sweet sound to His ears...'The music on this C.D. has all the elements that give us joy in all those times and speaks to us from the throne room.To Beth Moore and her music ministers, rock on!!! YOu have lifted me up.
POSITIVE	We have had our George Foreman grill for just less than a year and LOVE it. We bought it just after Christmas last year, as my dad got one for Christmas and immediately started telling us how much he loved it. It works great and the food tastes great. We now make hamburgers at home instead of going out to a fast food restaurant. It is nice to see all the grease drain out of the burger. I would definitely recommend everyone have one of these.
POSITIVE	"The movie ""The Light In The Forest"" was a ""two thumbs up"" movie. If I were to make a one word summary of my opinion I would say exhilarating. I really liked the movie. Some examples of elements are for one it gets interesting in the movie. For two it's more exciting than the novel. And for three I liked the conflict and the resolution. I enjoyed these elements because they were really exciting. The video does not compare to the novel. This is because some characters are missing and events were left out. Not to give out the ending, but the novel and the movie's ending was really different."
POSITIVE	My grandchildren love this game. It is very easy and very educational.I love it myself as well. Can only find it online...not found in stores and with shipping and handling it was very affordable.
NEGATIVE	This book seems more like a cathartic memoir of a woman's painful adoption experience rather than an unbiased helpful guide. As another reviewer wrote - who are her sources? Are they unbiased or did she seek out those with equally painful experiences? It doesn't seem to be a balanced or objective study. I couldn't even get through a third of this book - the melodrama put me off. I've read many other superior books dealing with adoption, loss, grief and attachment disorders.
NEGATIVE	It took me all of 2 months to break this replacement.I needed 2 years to destroy the original (motorola or AT&T;).
NEGATIVE	"I love Rocky & Bullwinkle, it reminds me of my childhood. When I saw this wonderful DVD set I thought to myself, ""Yes, I finally get to see the shows in the proper order."" Because I never watched it in the right order as a kid. I was dumbfounded and dismayed when I played it and found that it had been watermarked with an R&B in the corner of the screen. The fact that it blinks on and off is extremely distracting. I would expect this on TV, they do it to make you buy the DVD. But, this is outragous. It is still the only DVD set of Season 1 of Rocky & Bullwinkle, so I guess its better than nothing (but not by much)!"
NEGATIVE	They made this camera sound so perfect for a small child looking for his or her 1st camera - but my 9 year old was so disappointed with this product. When the battery dies, the pictures get deleted and the controls are not suited to a young child. It is difficult to tell even when the camera is turned on or off. It is very small (too small for my sons hands) and the pictures are of a very poor quality. Save your money on this one!
NEGATIVE	"DJ Rupture can be a Turntablist, but catchy hooks and consistent melodies is not his strenght. There is no linearity on his first effort, nor good ryddim'. The year this CD was released I saw many ads for this CD, the front CD recalled my attention and I though ""um, ok, good design and the label (Tigerbeat) is known, so...I will get it!""...oh...I shouldn't have. DJ Rupture sound between reggae and hiphop, sometimes it even sound like a poor imitation of PRODIGY...anyway, to be honest this CD is a bit boring, is not my kind of music perhaps?, on either case but I just can't understand it. I am sorry but I am going to the used CD store to trade for something else."
POSITIVE	Very prompt delivery. It is great to update my memory of the founding fathers. This, and a few other documents, should be required study in all schools. This would help to mold the nations future.
POSITIVE	I'm thinking about buying this cable, but several have mentioned that the tip/end/handle is too big to fit with other cables. I need to plug in 2 side by side. Can anybody that has this cable, measure the diameter or circumference of the end? Please clarify which dimension you're providing. Is it round or oval? If oval, what are the two diameters?Is there really a diffence between a $5, $20 and $100 fiber optic cable? I'm seeing people in both camps.Thanks!
POSITIVE	Kamahl wants the mirari. Kamahl is a mountain bararian on a quest to win the pit fighting championship and the mirari, an orb which not many can touch. Few people can hardly touch the mirari without it consuming their soul. Kamahl has heard this but still wishes to posses the legendary orb.Krosan beasts seek the orb as well. A giant dragon comes to the Cabal arena and many fighters work to kill it. In the end however Kamahl throws the final blow to the huge monstrosity. The monster falls on top of Kamahl and everyone believes that Kirtar, an order liutenant, destroyed the beast. As a prize kirtar recieves the mirari. Kirtar is then ordered to an Order encampment where Kamahl tries to follow him, but by the time he gets to the citadel, Kirtar is already dead. the Mir ambassador Laquatas takes the orb down underwater. By the sea does Kamahl wait for his chance to posses the mirari.
NEGATIVE	"I have ""Into the Labyrinth"" and ""Selections from North America"". I like all of Labyrinth and much of Selections. I found nothing I like on this album, DCD\DCD. To me the vocals, lyrics and overall sound come off as compressed and not interesting. For me it fits better in the noise category than the music category. Give it a listen to see what you think."
NEGATIVE	It is better to buy an inexpensive one because when the ice melts it leaks through the wood and I have to keep going back to put ice in the bucket because the space is so small. I have one that I bought for $16 and all I have to do is put the ice in one time and wait until it is done. It is not worth getting.
NEGATIVE	This movie is so boring. The first 45 minutes take place in the rain at night. Great cast but the whole movie is just dumb. No action at all, dumb story, unrealistic plot. Can I please have the last 90 minutes of my life back?
NEGATIVE	I just received these skates and opened the package to make sure the skates were okay before giving them to my daughter Christmas morning. Much to my surprise, on the soles of these skates, the rubber is SEVERELY discolored (brownish-yellow), to the point they look like they are 20 years old. Them being jammed into the box and bent didn't really help them look very good either. Needless to say these skates are going back tomorrow...not wasting my time ordering another pair when there obviously is not much quality control at amazon.
NEGATIVE	I have been using this razor for 2 months and lately I have been getting a lot of irritation and pimples. This razor does not get the stubborn more thick hairs like my old 35$ norelco used to-which I had used for 4 years. If it is not fully charged or plugged in, the razor is hopeless to get a clean shave on a partial charge. I have to go over areas many times.
NEGATIVE	I'd have been happier with a journal with just the date and space for entries, and not all the fill-in-the-blanks nonsense. That aside, the big problem is the quality of the book construction. After 2 years, 11 months, the cover has come off the book. I now have duck tape holding the thing together. And this is after very gentle treatment. This edition of the book is inferior in both quality of paper, page size, and as noted before, construction. If you can find something else that fits your needs, buy it.
POSITIVE	First and foremost, these shoes are quality. You can tell by looking at them that they are expensive shoes and when you put them on your feet it instantly becomes apparent. I can wear them all day standing with no foot fatigue at all.The styling is nice and I really like them but they do kind of look like bowling shoes. Personally, I give the styling a 2.5 out of 5 stars but the quality and comfort push these up to 4 stars in my book.
NEGATIVE	They charge $9.99 to determine if their product, while under warranty, is defective. Then they require the customer to pay return postage when replacing their defective router. Lastly, they promised to ship a replacement ethernet cable and after 6 phone calls to the other end of the earth did not deliver cable. Customer Service NOT
POSITIVE	Although I liked what I see regarding the whole set, I would prefer this outdoor item in teak for durability, weatherwise. They have more charm in my opinion in the teak because of the way it weathers to grey and can be left outdoors indefintely. Cedar can't do that. I would be willing to invest more money to have a better product and durability. Thank you
POSITIVE	The crocks were a bit darker in person but that isn't a problem for me. I bought these for my niece as a wedding present and they arrived very tightly packed (which made be very happy). Item was just as I expected and very well made. I was very happy with the price also.
NEGATIVE	"Please refer to the previous review by J.A. Eyon entitled ""The Magic's Gone."" I couldn't agree more. All the producers had to do was go back and read the wealth of stories that Marvel Comics has created over the years. And simply pick ONE! Instead, they hire a bunch of no-talent wanna-bes and come up with a lame, unbelievably cliched, pointless work of juvenile fiction that has nothing at all to do with the concept, intent, quality and integrity of the original character the movie is (supposedly) based on!Don't you think that's ""strange""...?!"
POSITIVE	I thought this book was good because the adventure in this book never stopped and it kept me into the book. I also like this book because it is too long but it isn't too short. This book may interest many book readers that like adventure and suspense.
POSITIVE	We got a box of these to put in gift bags for our sons' birthday party. What can I say: it's a box of gummi pizzas. I wouldn't recommend eating a whole box yourself, but sharing them with a bunch of kids works great.From a gummi candy standpoint, they're not the yummiest kind of gummi candy, but they have a bit more novelty with the pizza appearance.
POSITIVE	i love this box set i thought it was a little steep in price but you get what you pay for i liked all the movies but my favorites were the gravedancers unrest and reincarnation for the ture horror lover its worth checking out
POSITIVE	Since receiving this CD, I play it every day, I can dance to the music, chant along or both. I play it in my car or at home. It goes with me.
NEGATIVE	This game is very original with good graphics. The person who thought this up was very creative. (...) However, once you get in the game you will encounter a plethera of annoying bugs. Some of these are invisible creatures that won't move, creature won't eat or learn, creature won't interact with objects, missing sheep for sheep quest, etc. So you go download patch 1.10 and install it. Then when you try to run black and white it will start to run but the game never makes it far enough to start. It just freezes. So you use the EAsy program to report the problem (...) and that program locks up your system. Congratulations, you have just wasted (...) your hard earned money on a (...) buggy game. (...)
NEGATIVE	i thought they were going to have good music but their is all stupid british crap rock/pop music compelety uninteresting
NEGATIVE	"Wow! Here we go again: another theological movement being steered by untrained Bible enthusiasts. In the Preface it is noted that Noe (a motivational speaker by training) has never attended a theological seminary to study theology, biblical languages, church history, and so forth. And his book proves it!His main point in this book is to claim that ALL Bible prophecy was fulfilled in the first century and that the earth will last forever. He even recommends a new holiday to celebrate the Second Coming of Christ -- which in his view occurred in the first century: Parousia Day. Too bad the church has missed this opportunity for 2000 years.This new movement is quite a worrisome innovation. For more information, I recommend seeing Mathison's ""When Shall These Things Be?"" which is also available from Amazon.comTo Noe I say: Thanks. But no thanks. Come back with your innovative ideas AFTER you have taken some theological training."
NEGATIVE	"I bought this book and then turned around and got rid of it. Very disappointing to me. A word to the editor: spelling and grammar matter. There were consistent misspellings, such as ""seperate,"" and ""it's"" for the possessive ""its."" That's just shoddy and there's no reason for it--this is a formal publication, not an exercise for English Comp I. As to the content of the book, I was less than thrilled to see that the author had merely painted over the existing facial screening of the doll rather than removing the original paint and starting from scratch. And pardon me, but not everyone is into the ""Vegas showgirl"" look, which was the only fashion this book showcased. Very limiting. Overall an amateur effort."
NEGATIVE	The product works, but their customer service system is horrible.I had some problems with the license key, so I followed the instructions on the help and got to their support web site.Broderbund's support web site makes you go in loops until you finally find a form where you can submit your problem. The reply I got was useless and did not permit and continuous dialog. (in other words: there is no one to talk to - they never answer you back if you reply to their email).Their phone support service is also useless - you wait for 20 minutes while hearing endless menus, and then being disconnected just before you get to speak with anyone.That's the last Broderbund product I'm ever going to buy.
POSITIVE	Jackie Mason's observations on Yiddish are hilarious. You don't have to be Jewish to love this book!
POSITIVE	I bought this picture frame for my wife 2 years ago and it is still working great. The quality of the picture was the reason I bought it. It came with cool features and accessories. I definitively recommend it.
POSITIVE	Ana Menendez does a fantastic job expressing life as an immigrant. Through humor and uncanny examples and spanish phrases any Cuban is all too familiar with, she brings a sense of nostalgia with her words that reach and communicate not only to the Cuban people but to any group of people anywhere in the world. Fantastic read!
POSITIVE	The Dark Crystal is quite possibly one of the strangest movies to ever come out of the Jim Henson Creature Shop. That being said, it is probably also one of the best. This movie portrays the classic struggle of good versus evil with the side of good facing seemingly insurmountable obstacles. While I enjoyed this film as a child (although some parts were a bit scary) I find myself enjoying it even more as an [young] adult. What originally appeared to be a struggle between good and evil now shows itself that all people have both good and evil inside of them, and the two work in a natural harmony. In a day of pure digital characters, it is exciting to see Muppets in action. As far as digital technology has come, it still lacks the realism these characters portray. I highly recommend this film.
POSITIVE	"Using this product with 2 handsets for about 3 years. This is not a ""Mercedez-Benz"" phone but certainly an acceptable, reliable product. One handset has developed a problematic dialing button, but you just press it a little harder (smile). Handsets work better if they have fairly fresh batteries. Range is good when battery is strong."
NEGATIVE	I wasn't thrilled with this book; the diagrams are downright lousy...They are not photographs but rather cartoons and only 2 or 3 chord fingerings are showed in the entire book. Basically, this book just does not have enough information and material....Personally, I feel Guitar for Dummies was the best beginners instruction manual I have found.
POSITIVE	"There is something unmistakeably compelling about The Kills. VV & Hotel have a palpable chemistry on-stage that translates beautifully in the studio. There's this raw, urgent, detached energy to their sound that digs right into the soul of Garage Rock. VV's voice is clear and sensuous and Hotel has this sort of hoarse sexy whisper that compliments her perfectly.The fact that they choose to use a drum machine may feel incongruous to some rockers out there. I know it did to me at first. Yet as I've kept coming back to their stuff, I realize that it's part of their 'mystique' and definitely, for me, since there's no one else to compete with, makes this duo even hotter on stage.""Keep On Your Meanside"" will forever be embedded in my mind and heart, but ""No Wow"" will keep me going until I can see them live again!"
POSITIVE	These little docs look so cute on my daughter's feet, she loves wearing them! They are good, sturdy crocs and look great.
POSITIVE	First of all, I need to forwarn you, this book is NOT for beginers to astrology, it assumes you're already familiar with the basics.I found this book very helpful in my studies; it was a turning point in my use of this ancient science. Where basic natal astrology is useful for providing a basic pyschological profile for the client, the techniques described in this book point out how the progressions point to the evolution of the individual. It also goes into eclipses and how they describe events in the life.I would consider this book mandatory reading for anyone beyond the basics. 5+ stars for this one!
POSITIVE	Pretty good super-hero movie, but I'm feeling nostalgic for the corny old Superman movie. Sure, the graphics now are 10 times better, and even Superman's suit is alot sexier, but still....
POSITIVE	"I bought this as a replacement spool for my electric ""Twist N Edge"" trimmer. The spool fits perfectly on the trimmer. This replacement string performs the same as the original string. I did not rate this product 5 stars because I would like to have more string on the spool."
NEGATIVE	I have been very disappointed in this 5th Cape Light Novel. It is slow and boring. I am usually a VERY fast reader but it has taken me 4 weeks and I am still not finished with this one! I loved the first 4 books in this series but I think it is time to finish the series and be done with it. James is not a very interesting character and NOT hero material. While I have been wondering at Leigh's past, there hasn't been enough mystery to capture my attention for very long. Emily and Dan's marriage plans are boring also. About the only interesting thing that has happened yet is Jessica and Sam's child issues. I have found myself skipping parts and that says a lot for this book. Overall, the first 4 books in this series deserve 5 stars and this one....well...you should quit while you're ahead.
POSITIVE	I can't believe how much good stuff is crammed into this wonderful book. It makes me want to learn the Greek language. Every day's section leaves me dumbfounded that I haven't been taught this before now. If you are tired of Milk and are craving Meat, then this is the feast for you!
POSITIVE	While shopping around one night in book store, long before this novel was ever advertised by the movie version, it caught my eye. After reading the back summary, I did not expext much-you know the average teen age girl gets pregnant, struggles a little, and finally makes it to a stage in her life where she can be content-Wrong. This book was one that kept me turning the pages, as you read each chapter, Novalee, with her residence in Wal-Mart, Sister Husband, with her crazy, personality, Forney, with his stong and honest passion for Novalee, are sure to make you laugh, cry, and even at times think about the people who have touched your life. This story is beautifully written, while revealing some of the toughest situations in life that deal with a little bit of every department.
POSITIVE	I bought this book because I own Bad Cat. I think this book is witty and funny but not quite as good as the cat one. Most of the pictures did make me crack up laughing but I laughed harder and at more pictures in the cat book. I would still recommend it to anyone as it is really funny but they should definitely buy Bad Cat as well.
NEGATIVE	"Disappointed in the album and their concert last year. They are adding venues for '08. I'll be passing. I am sick and tired of giving bands my money, so they can insult me, my nation, and my God. They have the ""Free Will"" to hate. I have the Free Will to pass.One reviewer asked why the critics loved this album. If you want to get noticed and to be loved by the liberal establishment, just do lots of what they did on this CD---bash the above 3 items and bash them good. In case anyone doesn't get it, America is ""We the People"". When they bash the US, they are bashing all Americans. Some ally..."
NEGATIVE	I am so sorry that I had not heeded the warning of the other reviews. I am a Christian. This movie went in the garbage can after I gave it a chance to the bitter end.I do not even want to return it for a refund, because I would be afraid of perpetuating this nightmare by allowing a copy of it to still be in circulation.The acting is fifth rate. The cinematography is something I would have expected from my high school students, if this were still the year 1980. The story line could have been stronger. The special effects look like they were done before the internet was even invented. Some of the graphic porn like scenes are violent and offensive toward both sexes for the typical stereotypes they perpetrate for both the victim and the game player.
NEGATIVE	"Like some of the other reviewers who do not want to be swayed by public opinion (I particularly liked the ""emperor's new clothes"" analogy)--this book has got to be one of the worst things I have ever read. The prose is bad, the characters are uninteresting, and the story repeats itself over and over with no resolution at the end. The only reason I didn't throw it out the car window was that I was sure it had to get better. It didn't. Depressing start to finish. Sometimes you just wish you could get your money and your time back. Find something worthwhile to read--this book is not it."
NEGATIVE	Inconsistent quality, iffy installation in Windows, and diagnostics only in DOS. This is the Linksys LNE100TX. We have plenty of our customer who opt for this card and have ended=up regretting doing so. The price is what initially attracts, but the shabby construction, questionable installation, and high failure rate - not to mention Linksys' horrible customer support.Avoid this one. You're not saving any money buying this card. You're only gaining headaches and dissappointment with the Linksys card.
POSITIVE	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a unique movie were Scott Pilgrim has to fight 7 ex's inorder to win the girl he loves.I think Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a great movie.
POSITIVE	"Never in my life did I think anyone could accurately capture the things that go on in our heads. Now it has been done! I was moved to tears by this movie and continue to be every time I watch it. At first you are thinking, ""This is strange. I'm not sure what's happening here."" Before you realize it, you are reminded of your own memories and dreams.Of course, this is from the point of view of a man, but it is absolutely on the mark. You don't have to have the same memories as the characters in the film to feel the connection. It is so rare for a filmmaker/screenwriter to create characters and images that are so real. Jim Carrey is phenomenal as 'everyman'. I have never seen a better performance from him. Every nuance in this movie is realistic, even the surreal!The special effects, done in-camera (the old-fashioned way), are mind-blowing. This movie deserved several Academy Awards.I rank it in my top 5 of all time, and there hasn't been one of those since 1992 (Until the End of the World)."
NEGATIVE	"Received this phone/answering system to replace an older Panasonic system. Immediately found that the answering system does not have an LCD message counter! How useless is an answerer without the ability to be able to see how many messages you received and worse, after you play the messages there is no indication of how many are still left on the machine. Also, the annoying talking caller ID ""feature"" won't shut off even though there is a menu option to turn it off. Lastly, you can't set the volume up high enough to properly hear your messages without a completely silent room. Sending back to Amazon immediately! Note: Panasonic has removed the LCD message counter from all their new phones, so it's goodbye Panasonic."
POSITIVE	"If you're considering attending a Midwestern university, I highly recommend this book. In addition to typical information about universities, there are also testimonials from students about student life, organizations, and whether the campus parties are good. Some comments include: ""There's not really a lot to do"", ""The faculty care greatly about the students"", and ""Everyone drinks and the parties rock"". That's certainly not information the school's P.R. department would disclose!All in all, a wonderful guide (which I used) to determine which school fits you best."
NEGATIVE	feeder will not stay level, the bottom of the flat so it is like trying to carry water in a pizza pan. I have had the wind blow it off of the hook twice (in one week), the last time it broke hangar rod threads out of the plastic part. I now have it mounted on a pole and it works well. I wish I would have not wasted my money feeder. If you get it for under $3 including S&H and pole mount it, it may be worth it, not for me.
POSITIVE	This is a great cast album for a really great show. I saw it in DC with (of all people) Mac Davis, who did a wonderful job. Keith Carradine is the consummate Will, Dee Hoty is tremendous, and the rest of the cast was A-1. A triumph.
NEGATIVE	Hey I'm an Arnold fan, and I gues it's a reasonable action movie. But don't expect to much from the special effects, (cheesy) or the acting (awfull), or the storyline (very thin).
POSITIVE	I use Yesterday's News, unscented, for my rabbit. He seems to prefer it over other newspaper litters.The only trouble I have is in finding it! I wish it was on the Subscribe & Save program at Amazon, as I imagine shipping costs would kill the bargain.
NEGATIVE	I actually tried this stuff, and I can't really recommend it in good faith. It looks good in the bottle, but no cigar. It tasted like grocery pork and beans.
NEGATIVE	"How is it that the toy has a warning ""choking hazard: small parts. not for children under 3 years"" on the one hand, and on the other, its recommended ages is ""from 6 months to 3 years""?! Pay attention to the warning, u can miss it ..."
POSITIVE	I first bought this on tape, and my i add i played it so manytimes that i wore it out. Now that i have located your web site.I willnow buy this on cd and with great hopes this will last forever. END
NEGATIVE	The presentation of the book is very similar to the board game with King Candy as the host. It didn't have the number of pages I expected. It is the typical box shaped hard cardboard type book. The pages are very, very bright. Myself and my 5 year old scratched out the smells completely after only a few uses. I expected the smells to last much longer than that.
NEGATIVE	Yes, the photography of the movie is beautiful. However, watching the story was horribly slow. It was just boring to see how the relationship between Harrer and the Dalai Lama unfolds so slowly. No emotional strings were strummed. I sat there watching the movies like I spent seven years in Tibet. And when there is action, it is unfairly depicted. The movie makes the Chinese army into a mob of dehumanized villains. I feel that this is the most uncomfortable, high-production movie I have sat through in a very long time. If you want good drama, watch something like The Shawshank Redemption. If you want good cinematography, watch One Hour Photo. If you want a DVD coaster, use your Seven Years in Tibet DVD. Avoid this piece of junk unless you want to fall asleep.
NEGATIVE	"I have had 2 A120 units for about 5 years. One started acting up a couple months ago, with display problems. Now it just says ""NO PLAY"". I opened up the unit and it is dust free; I don't think there's anything I can do. No info at Panasonic web site.So these units seem pretty good, until they're not."
POSITIVE	The first novella in this book was good, and the second was really exceptional: interesting, insightful and vivid. I'm now reading 'A Thousand Acres' by the same author and enjoying it as well.
POSITIVE	"Chose this product following moderately thorough online search. It received very good reviews and price is reasonable compared to other brands. Tough to sort through all the types. 3"" thickness enough to make a 10 year old mid line mattress very comfortable and eliminated need for a new mattress. Make sure you buy sheets with sufficient ""depth"" to accommodate topper and mattress."
NEGATIVE	There are a lot of better rock autobiograhies out there at the moment. This one is very unfocused and you do not really get to understand what it really is about. The photos from his booth are interesting though but also do not make sense. A shame.
POSITIVE	"Ozzy aquires the remarkable guitarist Zakk Wylde and creates a super charged album with tonnes of energy which is distributed evenly throughout. The track 'Miracle Man' (his stab at tv avangelist Jimmy Swaggert, who actually got caught with a prostitute)is great...since Jimmy used to bash and label Ozzy and various other acts as being nothing but ""devil worshipers"". Great stuff. Other highlights include, 'Crazy Babies', 'Breaking All The Rules' and also interesting but not as good is his song about serial murderer Charles Manson 'Bloodbath in Paradise'. Greatly executed and thought provoking metal/hard rock. Check it out."
POSITIVE	I had no idea Sean Connery was in this movie based on a great book by Michael Crichton. This film was fun, exciting, and very enjoyable and gave me a great understanding of the times and helped me with my understanding about the steampunk genre as well. Read the book, but enjoy the movie.
NEGATIVE	These little seed things dried out too quickly, and did not give the yield I got from more traditional seed starters. The ease of use was not worth it.
NEGATIVE	"My son had to have one of these. So I bought one even though it is WAY over priced. It takes 5 minutes to put the nano in it and takes way to too much force to put this on. The clip on the back stratches your ipod and yes, the rubber does prevent your nano from sliding around the table top or dash board it but is now impossible to slide into your pocket. Also the screen ""protector"" is a joke and slides around and ironically scratches the screen. It too is almost impossible to install."
NEGATIVE	There is not a one minute span of video where David does not crawl, slither, scamper, or sneak his way into the shot amongst nature's exotic cold-blooded creatures. Who really wants to see an 80 year old man sun bathing on the rocks with iguanas? Such a disappointment.
POSITIVE	I LOVED this book. It all starts off with a normal, everyday person at work. He is a pilot and he has to deal with the emotion, and stress when people just disappear from his airplane (and from around the world.) It has several real life charaters that has to deal with this end-of-the-earth days. Many of which don't seem to understand what has happened. It is a gripper with a slightly slow period in the first 1/4 of the book. However it makes up for it in the twist and turns that you don't see coming. It includes the basics of the last chapter in the Bible. It is wonderful to have some fiction that is based on the bible. It is not a replacement for the Bible. And it should not give anyone the ideal that this is what the bible says exactly. But it is great for a fun loving drama fiction that keeps you on your seat. I think even a non-believer would love this book.
POSITIVE	Do you think that we could win a war in the event one ever broke out? Are our current manpower levels enough to thwart off attacks from third world dictators? Can we suppress outbreaks of violence in the world?In this 450 plus page book, which may house hypothetical situations, you'll read what could happen. You find yourself asking questions about our military leadership and you will even start to look at the world in a different light.Weinberger's knowledge of military tactics, strategy and defense planning our unmatched and unparalleled. He was Secretary of Defense for over seven years. His knowledge of world politics is with a doubt superb.Most impressive is the ability to show the complexity of the situations and show how the United States armed forces are matched against the world. Weinberger's works is nothing short of a miraculous - excellent reading!
POSITIVE	This is the quintessential entry-level recording for those keen on exploration of not only some of Jobim's greatest tunes, but some of Getz' and Gilberto's finest performances. Nearly every track has you tapping your feet and longing for a martini. Much more should be said about this excellent collection, but I'll leave it to the ears. Buy it!
POSITIVE	This movie arrived in good condition. The movie was a great teaser of the nature of tech and the issues that arise from loosing the human aspect of relationships.
POSITIVE	LOVE. Get that Cali girl bright white smile. Results are fantastic. Warning: If you have sensitive teeth you may hate this product. I never noticed sensitivity before this, but did in the hours after using a strip. The directions indicate that if you experience sensitivity you should not use twice a day and maybe use something like once every couple days. This really helps. Also, I brush with Sensodyne PRONAMEL during the couple weeks I am using the whitening strips. These two tips eliminated any sensitivity and I still had great results. It was at least a year before I noticed a less white smile, and then I just bought a new pack.
NEGATIVE	Bought this because I have a couple outbreaks a year and thought I would be ready for the next one. Followed all the instructions and the light would not come on. Replaced the battery not knowing how long it may have been in the unit on a shelf and nothing. The silver tip looked like it had already been in contact with the emery board so I was probably sold a defective unit to begin with. It was a lot of money so I can't imagine they thought no one would notice. Geez.
NEGATIVE	Everything wrong here... The actors performances are awful, unbalanced. AS for the sharks...forget about them. apparentl all shot from them were traken for any given Discovery documentary... The bad guys are a joke... well, it was a sad experience watching this one...
NEGATIVE	I love this show! And I enjoy listening to the music very much. Unfortunately, entertainment comes much more from the new recording starring Victor Garber. Not to mention, the singers in the newer version are MUCH better...I am quite dissappointed with Ray Walston. He was great with the comedy in the film, but in the music, he shows little promise. I do like some of the approaches to the music in the old version, though. Gwen Verdon is great! Yet, pickups in the music is slightly off and tempo seems slightly uneven. But if you're simply trying to learn the music for an audition, GET THIS. It's just not the most entertaining stuff you can get! :)
POSITIVE	I remember this book from high school and loved it. I took the time 4-5 years later to re read and I still love it! Its a quick easy read that you cant put down. You are instantly transported to this future world and the fascination to be pretty. Looking forward to delving into the next book in the series, Pretties.
NEGATIVE	This book does not take you through quantum computing in any logical way. The author does not explain where he is going with his lengthy examples in each section. Instead he tends to launch into hard to follow, artificially concocted examples with little rationale and then move to the next topic without a conclusion or a reason for why he put the reader through such boring experience. The discussion of the Bohr - Einstein debate told me nothing of what the debate was about and there are many references to the EPR without any real explanation of what was in it. There must be a better way to understand this subject else I will have to conclude that Einstein was right and God really does play dice. Give this book a miss... it is simply not worth the effort. Even my one star is generous.
POSITIVE	"This is a very good album by Helix. Certainly not their best work, but that's a testameant to the band, not a knock on this album. The songs are rock n' Roll without a doubt, but with a very melodic and catchy tone to them. I guarantee you'll be enthralled by the deeply hypnotic ""Storm"". You'll be singing along with ""Midnight Express"" and ""Rockin' Rollercoaster"". Of course, that's only the beginning...I could go on and on, but I won't. I recommend this album"
POSITIVE	Great features, great quality product for the money. Dislike the lack of attachments or other options, compared to the kitchen aid model but it does everything I need it for.
NEGATIVE	I basically bought this product to listen to music music and watch movies on the ipad with my wife when travelling, but it does not work at all.For movies, only part of the audio was clear (the music track and some effects). The voices and most of effects are just muted or heavily distorted.I guess this might not be compatible with modern jacks (three stripes jacks)Of course, I would not recommend this whatsoever.BIG disappointment.
POSITIVE	"""Nappily"" was entertaining!. However, the characters of Venus and Khandi worked my nerves. Both were shallow and had agendas. A lot of time was spent on Venus and her ""finding herself"" which is what we need to do from time to time, but so much time was devoted to this. We were privy to the main characters' thoughts which was an insight into each of them.The book's opening left you ""hanging"". I surprised by the ending. I give the writing a four (which is what reviews are about?). I was not bored!"
POSITIVE	"I've had acne since 4th grade. Despite being told I'd ""grow out of it"", I still have it at age 23. I've tried what feels like every over-the-counter product available. I was doing moderately well using Neutrogena products when I decided to try Klear Action. After 3 weeks most of the blotchyness was gone. After 2 months I had about 2-5 pimples a month that came and WENT QUICKLY. At the 4 month mark I tried to be cheap and use AcneFree. Big Mistake. All my progress went bye-bye. I went back to Klear Action and am VERY pleased with the results. I can finally wear red or burgundy with out it bringing out redness in my face! I use it twice daily religiously and will not bother trying any other product. This truely works!"
NEGATIVE	This hideout will not stand up on its own. I don't know how they got it to stand up like that for the picture because I can't even make it stand up by leaning the two top edges together like a teepee. I paid less than $10 for it and it still isn't worth the money. There are only wires running rectangularly through two sides and there is no support across the front or back of this thing. This was so disappointing to my son!
POSITIVE	This is an excellent romantic comedy about being able to go back in time and change the mistakes made in a previous relationship. It is extremely funny in places but at other times very sad. It stars that wonderful British actor Douglas Henshall(Angels and Insects) who plays the main character of Victor Bukowski. He is desperate to stop his ex girlfriend Sylvia from marrying another man. He is given a chance to go back in time change the mistakes he made in their relationship, but it doesn't quite work out as planned.
NEGATIVE	"I thought this would work with my wet salt collection, as it is billed as a ""wet salt"" grinder....i am thinking of returning it. The perfomance is SO BAD!"
NEGATIVE	This book is very detailed (though not endnoted very clearly). In fact, I suspect the author may have been paid by the word...Unfortunately, it is not very cohesive. He makes a good case that bad things happen in the world, and that Israel negotiates often with US involvement, but I do not think he ties the two together into any sort of causal relationship, which is what the book promises. Just because two phenomena occur does not mean they are related to each other. I was hoping it could clearly make such an argument, and wanted him to succeed, since I know people who recommended this book. But he failed for me.
NEGATIVE	Unlike PD James, Ruth Rendall, or Donna Leon, who also write long-running detective serials, Elizabeth George seems to be unable to sustain the quality of her Thomas Lynley series. In With No One as Witness she switches from her typical intimate family murder to a poorly-constructed serial killer tale. And, in a bizarre plot twist that strains credibility past the breaking point, she breaks up her extremely endearing group of long-running characters. The Thomas Lynley - Helen Clyde subplot has been the best and perhaps the most widely-followed continuing side story in mystery fiction since Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. Why she ended it by killing off Helen smacks of creative breakdown to me; it's very disappointing that she could not have come up with any other way to create new dramatic conflict in her series. I can't recommend this book, nor, by anticipation, any of its sequels. What a disappointment.
NEGATIVE	After reading the reviews and waiting until the last day before my trip to Galapagos to get these shoes, I was hoping they would be perfect for wet landings followed by casual hikes. Unfortunately, I got a blister on my instep the first time I wore them, thanks to a rough insole that is raised up. Not only could I not wear the shoes after that, I was uncomfortable in any shoes for a week. What a waste!
POSITIVE	"I have grown up reading Stephen King's fiction and now it feels as if we have both reached maturity together (myself in reading tastes and King in writing). This is the author I saw glimpses of in reading ""The Body"" and ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshenk Redemption."" Reading it made me rethink the story of Christ and pick up ""Hearts in Atlantis"" and ""Bag of Bones."" Absolutely spellbinding!"
NEGATIVE	Like the Box says no Hendrix Music and No Hendrix performances. They werent lying. What a bore. Some good interviews though, especially from the Hendrix family. Nice to see Leon have his say.
NEGATIVE	I haven't watched the whole dvd yet, but after watching the Christmas one I'm not interested. The only thing I did like were the differant parts Jackie Gleason played. This was supose to be a Christmas show, but it certainly didn't seem like a Christmas show to me. This was a gift for someone and after watching it together we were both VERY diasppointed!
POSITIVE	I bought this for my five year old granddaughter for Christmas. And my daughter wants one now. It is very well made and looks very elegant. I don't think it was intended for a child but my granddaughter loves it. Makes her feel all grown up. Great product! NOT cheaply made like the price would make you think.
POSITIVE	I've owned a lot of coffeemakers, but this one is about perfect.A) The price is great, relative to similar products.B) The carafe maintains a great temperature, without any complex sealing apparatus -- to pour, you simply pour. Even partially empty, the carafe maintains a satisfactorally hot temperature (if not piping, but the laws of thermodynamics are what they are)for a couple of hours. I've never tried leaving it completely full to test maximum heat retention, but I suspect it might go 3-4 hours.C) It has an automatic shutoff, a clear window to watch the reservoir fill, and an overall design that is both contemporary and compact.Really, there's no reason to buy a maker with a burner anymore, no reason for burnt coffee. This is all you can ask for, really.
NEGATIVE	This is a book you cannot read like a novel; even as a diary, it is hard to understand, because entries are short and there are many unintelligible initials and half-words. It is a book for scholars, not for the average reader.
POSITIVE	I love this thing! I have my components in an antique sideboard and now I can keep the doors shut and control everything. I set the leapfrog receiver on top of my amp and shut the door and the signal bounces off the inside of the door... no need to use the adapter that came with the unit. Setup took all of one minute and have used it now for a couple of months with no problems.
POSITIVE	Folks, I'm not typically a genre fan--be it Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror, etc. I'm more interested in literary fiction, and since most of the stuff written in the above genres is simply laughable (Robert Jordan, that Lord Foul Bane junk (horrible), Terry Brooks, etc.) I often do not delve into the world of pop fantasy fiction. But Tolkien is a rare find, kids. He's written a fantasy series that holds up as literarue. Tolkien, an Anglo-Saxon specialist, has given us a modern-day Beowulf, Sir Gawain, and Fairy Queen all rolled up in one. Before Professor Tolkien, one had to go back to those old texts to read fantasy. Thank God, Tolkien decided to give a try at writing one himself.
POSITIVE	Ron Chernow made me feel as if he weresitting in living room telling me the sotry of a brillent little boy who rose to great heights.
POSITIVE	This feels, and is, very solidly built. D-shaped handle easy for pushing. Shaft is thick with long ridges making it easy to hold. The shovel is the proper length to minimize bending over. The shovel portion is strong plastic with a metal edge. The metal edge is a thick metal that is bolted multiple times to the underneath of the plastic shovel so it should be securely fastened. Yes, I live in Atlanta, but we get snow about 2-3 times a year that I need to push off the drive way (else it partially melts and may refreeze into ice). Luckily we don't get enough to have to shovel, lift, and throw into a pile. Regardless, I am very satisfied with the quality and price -- which replaces my old, short, flat shovel that strained my back.
NEGATIVE	I found this book short on Joe Hooper and long on an attempt at a historical critique of the politics of this country during the Vietnam war. The two authors obviously never served but more to the point, they continually drifted away from the man and bombarded the readers with their perception of the politics, personalities and philosophies of that time and place. I think the authors missed the barn by about 8 yards. Those of us who lived through the war, and most importantly, those days of the 60's, vividly remember the atmosphere that existed in this country. I wanted, no needed, to know better the man, Joe Hooper, not just that he had feet of clay but what he was about and why he like so many ohers of us, answered the call of the bugle. That would have been the real story. Instead, we were treated to the authors rather flawed analysis of the people and the reasons for that terrible and costly endeavor.
NEGATIVE	"Metallica is DEAD. I hope and pray that they stop here and never release another piece of garbage like this again. I don't think I've ever heard a worse-sounding metal album. Everything is out of place, everything is distorted, EVERY SINGLE TRACK sounds EXACTLY the same, the vocals are horrible, there is no guitar work, it is nothing but noise.By the way, if you would like to see how an 80s metal band can come back with a triumph and blow their fans' minds with the old-school sound and amazingly well-written songs, buy the new Iron Maiden's album ""Dance Of Death"". You'll thank me later."
NEGATIVE	Fortunately, this book was published in paperback, so I only wasted $8 on it. The plot is completely implausible with holes large enough to fly the shuttle through. There is no character development, the author's view toward women is sophomoric, and there are only about two pages of suspense at the end of the book. Take a pass on this one.
POSITIVE	Our daughter wanted this item for Christmas and she received it from Santa and is happy. Therefore, we are happy. Great cost.
NEGATIVE	I am highly disappointed with this swing. It doesn't swing fast enough for my 1 month old and it doesn't even work with my friend's 7 month old. I even called Fisher Price and recieved a new motor and it still doesn't move very fast. Aside from the looks we have had nothing but trouble. The music also has a mind of it's own at times. I would never recommend this swing to anyone!
POSITIVE	We purchased this tackle box as a starter kit for our son and daughter-in-law. Had many of the basics to hit the lake or river right away!
POSITIVE	I now own all ten seasons of the simpsons out on DVD, and to be honest, if you compare them by season, this is unfortunately the worst one. (maybe it's better than season one, which was a huge experiment anyways). BUT WAIT! I don't find it unwatchable, it's rather enjoyable, I laugh through it, it's better than a lot of TV over the past ten years (especially in the comedy genre). So I would rank this as a buy, but if you are looking for a gift for someone who does not own any on DVD, I would pick seasons 3,4,7 or 8. The Tokyo episode is the best one. AND, for practical purposes, I would stay away from the plastic simpsons head cases and buy this one instead.
NEGATIVE	"The box lists approx running time of 55 min., the tape says 36 min. However long it really is...it's pretty worthless. If you want an overview of reflexology, if you want to hear two reflexologists drone on and on about the benefits of it, this tape is for you. I wanted to learn some technique, but was very dissapointed. I guess you get what you pay for. I won't be buying any more videos available from ""Current"". [...]"
NEGATIVE	I have been buying Fluffies at JC Penney for 15 years.These are NOT Fluffies. Not even close!Lesson learned: You get what you pay for.
NEGATIVE	I will start by saying that my sister is an addict of this game. So is my friend, who has not only moved into town but has already payed off and made an addition to his little virtual house. I, personally, can't stand this game.I have played this for maybe 30 minutes, and that was enough for me. Very slow paced and boring.
POSITIVE	For someone who doesn't mind playing an action game by themselves for long amounts of time than this is a game for you! This game is a first person shooter but putting you in the era of World War 2 is what it does best. Everything from the beaches to the towns to the barracks looks vintage but renewed for the game and the overall playing of the game is excellent. It took me more than 2 weeks to beat this game and I consider that a good and lengthy game. The missions are cool and never stop, you are constantly on the run and checking every direction and corner for an enemy waiting to witness your demise!
POSITIVE	I love this thing! It's the fastest waffle maker I've ever used and it has an awesome setting for making the waffle crisp on the outside and moist inside. It even cooked the waffles thoroughly and quickly withe the blueberries I put in the batter. It's quick, easy to clean, makes tasty waffles and the best part is they're HEARTS!!! <3
NEGATIVE	It would be nice if a product which advertised Keystone Kops had Keystone Kops on the films. In fact this is Keystone Comedy films, but mostly without the Kops. Out of four Keystone Comedy films only one has a brief sequence with the Keystone Kops. If you're looking for Keystone Kops, this isn't it. The cover art is about all you'll get.
NEGATIVE	How did Leopold come to know so much about Puccini's La Boheme which was finished in 1896 and premiered in 1900 when he time-traveled straight from 1876 to the present? This nagging question ruined my enjoyment of the chick flick.
NEGATIVE	My machine is less than one year old and upon the fourth time I used it, the engine stalled a couple of times and finally wouldn't start. I couldn't pull the cord out anymore. I took it to the dealer and he said he got some gas out of the carburator bowl and claims I had no oil in my gasoline. This is simply not true. He claims the engine is seized because of it. It's now a case of he says, I say......I still the have the fuel mix I drained out of the tank for safety purposes since I was taking it to the dealer in my car. The gas clearly has oil in it..... I called Toro today and was told to call back on Monday and speak to a supervisor.... Hoping that Toro backs their product.
NEGATIVE	"Just when it seemed that George Lucas was going to relent and release the Original Unaltered Trilogy, he pulls a fast one and yanks te rug right from underneath the fans that have been begging and pleading for them for years.Not only are these sold as ""Bonus Discs"" bundled with the twice released 2004 Special Editions with all that additional CGI garbage, but the movies that made him rich and famous are getting a disrespectful treatment. The DVDs of the theatrical cuts are transfered from 13 year old Laserdisc masters and not even getting the industry standard widescreen anamorphic treatment. Even with the excuse that these are just bonus discs bare in mind that thi is the first Star Wars DVD where the bonus extras are not anamorphic widescreen -- ironically it's a Star Wars movie."
NEGATIVE	I got this for my son he likes it but after having it a couple weeks Dusty quit talking and wont talk anymore. I contacted amazon and they said they qould give me a credit but they didnt have any to replace it with. So amazon did good on thier part of trying to take of the situation.
POSITIVE	The only downside to this radar detector is to set the compass. You will need a retail store parking lot (empty) to drive in circles (3 times) to set the compass. After that the radar detector is such a beauty. It will detect all the bands specified in the description, I know it for a fact. It will detect a speed radars about a mile and a half away in any direction. In open highway it will go as far as 2 1/2 miles. This product has definitly saved me from several tickets.
NEGATIVE	". . . moving around in that red dress, it doesn't quite make it. Seriously the two ""Fire"" songs are quite good. The last song is your basic rock and roll anthem, big wall of sound, and really great vocals (not Lane of course, but she lip syncs with the best of 'em). It's all very dated now."
POSITIVE	Love the series and am glad to find the boxed series at a reasonable price. It is too bad that the tv show isn't on anymore, but now I can enjoy the episodes that they did run over and over.
NEGATIVE	Why does this talentless Pepsi vendor still have a recording contract? She cannot hold a candle to her peers such as Christina. The whole packaging of the 'new Britney' is a blatent, desperate attempt to avoid ending up on an episode of VH1's where are they now!
NEGATIVE	...[Let] me tell you, this phone is more trouble than it is worth. Reception is horrible -- so bad that sometimes I had to swith to my cell phone which had much better reception. The answering machine resets everytime the power goes out and resetting it is much more trouble than it should be......
POSITIVE	One of my favorite movies of the year. Shoenaerts crackles with electricity from beginning till the end, the tension he creates is extraordinary. Also, one of the most original stories to hit theaters in years.
POSITIVE	If we judge a movie not by the script alone but by the acting, costumesand scenes, this movie has it all.Everyone has the book to start from in making the movie:some have chosen to make a children's movie and made vanilla pirateswithout the violence or language of the original.I think this movie with some realistic blood and gutsfilming is more faithful to the originalthan any other version that I have seen.I liked the movie.
NEGATIVE	"Uh, don't try to understand anything out of his mouth on this one... a 24 bit master of tapes that sound like poo do nothing to improve the atmosphere and it's pointless to mix this in 5.1! One would think that better recording techniques and equipment were available in 1991. No cool extras except the ""liner notes"" DVD segment with a nice, short band/Shane bio... other than that, no cool extras at all. I love the Pogues but cannot stomach this waste of plastic DualDisc."
NEGATIVE	not for today. information is out of date. went to one of the doctors meetings in longmont colorado back in the 70's and it was very interesting. we followed his instructions and it seemed to be working but we had to move and there wasnt any doctors in that area that supported his system, so it went by the wayside. we found out later that the doctor was arrested and blackballed by the AMA. sad!
POSITIVE	what can i say? it was cheap, it was fast, it works great. highly recommend. Was a little hesitant based on bad reviews but everything was perfect.
NEGATIVE	I hate this game! This is the worst platformer ever. Super Mario Sunshine is way better. Xbox sucks!!!! 4-D. Yeah right. It just copied Super Mario Sunshine. Have you noticed that the thing that dorky cat carries is kind of a combo between Luigi's vacuum, and Mario's FLUDD. Who wants a lame time controlling thing! FLUDD is way cooler. Sorry Xbox geeks, but Blinx is just not worth your money.
NEGATIVE	"This is a truly amazing game but unfortuately, it has some real problems that cause it to crash periodically. After about twenty minutes of gameplay, the software locks and Windows tells you that ""Crysis has stopped working"". I am running the game on a brand new Dell Inspiron 620s with 6Gb of Ram and it locks up about every twenty minutes.I strongly urge potential buyers to read all the reviews on this game (Amazon and other game sites) before purchasing. I wish I had done the research."
POSITIVE	well first of all ncis rules!! i adore all the heroes, the story and especially gibbs!!Its not just a normal criminal series, it is funny and keeps you anxious! buuuuuuut it was really sad that kaite died i liked her ncis will never be the same:/
NEGATIVE	These are indeed the short, static hand wraps. You don't want static wraps, period. They're also too short.
POSITIVE	The Franny story is a scary account of someone coming unhinged made even more disturbing by her youth. Like Salinger's other two-tale collection, one feels like a real story with arc and all. The other seems unformed - rewarding nevertheless, but demanding of the reader's full attention.
POSITIVE	I have the entire set of Malawi....everything!!!! I LOVE IT! My daughter is now 9 months old and she simles every time we walk into her room! I suggest if you can buying the boarder and wall hangings....it really makes the room look wonderful. Another suggestion is painting the walls bright yellow...it looks great with the pattern! I give the entire Malawi collection 5 huge stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
POSITIVE	Loved the product and it shipped quickly! Seems like a great company. Great price for the amount of product I received.
POSITIVE	The book has been very useful. Good sound advice. Supports what my Dr. says---Move more and adjust what you eat. Addresses what needs to be done long term---not just another one of those fad diets.
NEGATIVE	Disappointing. This book is not particularly well-written. Heller waxes majestically about the scenery and topography he sees, but I still can't visualize it. And he shifts his voice several times throughout the book, sometimes writing as if he were delivering sacred text, other times casually reaching out and attempting to speak to the reader one-on-one. It's hard to get a feel for the story he's trying to tell. Add that to the fact that there is not a single compelling character in the book and it makes it a little tough to slog through. I find that I just don't care what happens to these people. And this may sound silly, but an adventure book without pictures of the location is a bad idea. I hate to sound like I'm in 4th grade, but it would have been really helpful to have some visual aids to understand the geography they were in and the effect of the water on their kayaking. No photos. It hurts the book.
POSITIVE	Quick shipping and worked perfectly as it should. Prices were much better then the local stores and I never had to leave the house.
NEGATIVE	We have a few of these cups that my daughter uses. The main problem is that the insert that creates the drip free - comes loose fairly easily during usage. Then you realize it once the liquid inside runs out if the cup in left on it's side. If you use these cups, just keep on eye on it.
POSITIVE	All original hits. The songs on this CD are all wonderful, considering their breadth of style. Song list (since it's not listed):1. Brand New Key - Melanie2. Clean Up Woman - Betty Wright3. Jungle Fever - Chakachas4. Nice To Be With You - Gallery5. Suavecito - Malo6. I Gotcha - Joe Tex7. Hot Rod Lincoln - Commander Cody & Lost Planet Airmen8. Oh Girl - Chi-Lites9. How Do You Do? - Mouth & MacNeal10. Rock Steady - Aretha FranklinThis collection of hit songs is especially interesting. Humor songs are well represented in Hot Rod Lincoln and I Gotcha. Funky, danceable numbers are included in Rock Steady, Clean Up Woman, and the risque Jungle Fever. Oh Girl is a classic soul ballad, whereas the soft Suavecito has a slight Latin flair. Brand New Key and How Do You Do could be described as cutesy, whereas Nice To Be With You is good mainstream pop. Many of these songs are otherwise hard to find. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes great early 70s hit songs.
POSITIVE	I upgraded my graphics card and needed a new power supply to go with it, checked this out and its working perfectly! The installation was incredibly easy, It's dimensions were exactly the same as my old 250w power supply so it fit perfectly into position. Took about 15 minutes total to remove old PSU and install the new unit. The Fan is incredibly silent, I got the power I need, all is well and I am content!!
POSITIVE	If you're into the old COF, I would recomend this cd even though it only has 6 tracks they are just amazing. Everything kicks ass in this cd vocals, guitars, drums........ Im serious this is a must have. Just buy it, no joke.
NEGATIVE	"I was surprised to play a Megaman game that sucked that bad! The characters from the original are still cool but man... the newer characters and the newer plot just make the game so weird. It is more difficult, more ""beat around the bush,"" a lot more fighting which gets really annoying after a while, and too many things going on at once. If you like that stuff go ahead and get it. I was thoroughly disappointed when I bought this game... I thought it'd be better than the first. What was I thinking?!?!"
POSITIVE	I purchased this Lodge 3 Quart Enamel on Cast Iron Dutch Oven for my Mom. She had been wanting a smaller dutch oven. She just loves it. She wanted a red one and the Island Spice color was just perfect. We have used Lodge cast iron products for many years. I highly recommend Lodge to all my friends and relatives.
NEGATIVE	I would avoid this 'mission control' headsets for a number of reasons, especially since there are a number of alternatives. First, you will soon be annoyed by the microphone 'ball' which dangles unnecessarily in front of your mounth. At this stage in audio technology, the microphone can be near the ear piece and still pick up and filter out appropriate sound. Second, there is no reason to have these in glow colors. If there is any thing that you don't want to 'show off' it is a headset. If you want to spend just a little money, check out the AT&T 90800 headset. It works very well and is dirt cheap. If you want more comfort and really plan to use this device, go with the Plantronics M175 -- I think it is worth the price difference and have used multiple units over the past 3 years.
NEGATIVE	I admit that I could not finish this book...it was simply too boring and slow paced a read. I am tired of fantasy novels that attempt to create a complexe political world without action. This is mostly political court intrigue. Tiring to read.
NEGATIVE	"Not even close to Dark Side of the Moon, Animals or The Wall, this album shows the Dark Side of PF -packing together 23 minutes of lame sound effects with a couple chords and calling it ""an epic song"" (also known as Echoes). Same can be said of the rest of the album. Oh well, they were good musicians indeed -but anybody can have a faux pas."
POSITIVE	Great techno rhythm fused with a retro beat. Sort of '70s meets the Millennium. Mostly instrumental with a few wonderful works with Beth Hirsch, whose voice is amazing. Every track is great, but Kelly Watch The Stars, All I Need and You Make It Easy are exceptional.
NEGATIVE	"my grnpa hes bn raising ""beef creeters"" for a long time.. he is a honrble man and his dad was to. thy work hard to make mony and feed us and stuf, so why are you su down on them???????????he has a bunsh of acrekers and he trets them good so how coum you dont like him????"
POSITIVE	This is a very unique CD. Nearly 80 sprawling minutes of twisted beats, ethnic vocals, and blunted dub style production. It's a trip around the globe in your headphones. A wild mix of acoustic and electronic textures- it's not like anything you've ever heard. Don't miss this hidden gem. They also have a cool website/netlabel with tons of free music called CosmicCartel.com
POSITIVE	"I started smoking, I realize after reading this book, because of a low self esteem problem that I had when I was only 13 years old. I am now 39 and have not smoked in one year. I recently went on a ""girl"" vacation with some high school buddies and started puffing on the odd cigar. 3 weeks later I have bought a pakage of cigarettes. I feel very very lousy for doing it and feel the need to get my own copy of this book and read it again. And again, if I have to. I do not want to be a smoker again, I have enjoyed so much freedom from them. I do a one hour work out daily and have never felt so good in all of my life. Thank you Mr Allen Carr for this wonderful freedom that I thought I would never have. I still have people raving about the fact that I quit, because even they did not think I could."
NEGATIVE	Don't mistake this for anything but what it is -- a purely trashy read. All of the main characters spend the book lying to each other and practicing deceit. None of them are particularly likeable, and their dialogue and sex scenes are mawkish, but there's a cheap thrill in the jaw-dropping coldness with which they treat each other.It's a cute way to empty your head for a few hours before you read something more substantial.
POSITIVE	"This in a fine CD. The Wagner pieces are rich, superbly balanced in the lower brass and horn sections (most notably). Furthermore, the Respighi La Boutique Fantasque, is a sleeper. One most often thinks of the ""Pines"" as the only symphonic band epic here. The ensemble does a great job with dynamics/contracts, a very interesting interpretation. I do prefer the impact of a ""full"" symphonic band versus an ensemble however in Elsa's Procession. The only CD/recording that I would suggest as an alternative would be in the University of Illinois Symphonic Band collection.It would give Eastman a run for the money, but you have to contact UI direct. You can't find the band recordings any more and therefore Eastman, as the most prolific symphonic training institution for brasses/winds, can't be beat in most cases."
NEGATIVE	"It is undeniable that there is an alluring element to any release advertised as a front man's (of an entertaining band, such as Millencolin) acoustic side project. Nevertheless, based on the contrived and banal nature of ""Lock-Sport-Krock"" Nikola Sarcevic planned to cash in on the marketability of the name he's created for himself through his successful Swedish Punk Rock outfit. Mr. Sarcevic seems to have forgotten one thing; copying lines from his diary he kept as a middle schooler and passing them off as lyrics is not going to earn him any dignity among the critics. Noteworthy: ""Lovetrap.""2/5"
POSITIVE	Padma herself had given this book to an ex boyfriend of mine (who kept it)and I have been dying to find it ever since. The recipes of her native Indian quisine are still lingering on my taste buds. The recipes I found to be foolproof and easy. I have impressed many guests with her simply delicious meals. I hope the Men who bought this book could look past Padmas beauty and media coverage and just expierience the quality of these delightful dishes. Her where to buy section is also very helpful but not Mandatory to get mouthwatering results.
POSITIVE	"Wow! I don't usually buy short workouts because I tend to think of them as ""easy""... well recently I have been very busy as a full-time college student working part-time so I decided to try this. I love it! I can honestly say that I look forward to my 10 minute workouts and can definitely feel it!"
POSITIVE	got this as a joke gift on vhs almost ten years ago. it became a staple at parties with friends instantly. everyone loves it. wore the tape out, had to come here to get the dvd. five stars, easy. highly recommended.
POSITIVE	JENEIFER JONES IS BREATHTAKING IN THIS MOVIE. SHE PLAYS THE HUMBLE FRENCH COUNTRY GIRL WHO IS DETERMINED TO BE SOMEBODY .VAN HEFLEN IS PERFECT AS THE MEEK DOCTOR WHO DOSENT HAVE A CLUE TILL ITS TO LATE. SHE WAS BAD AND DONE HIM WRONG. GREAT MOVIE
POSITIVE	Ok, SO i get the bb's fast within like 4 days, and when i open them, i notice it looks nice,however there was no cap on top, no joke seriously. NO CAP thank gosh i had another bb top so it fit perfectly on it. Oh yea and in the picture the bb's are dark green, there actually light green which i love. This would have gotten 5 if it only had the cap.
NEGATIVE	"I bought this for my 2 year old and 3 year old girls who love Blue's Clues. I am disappointed that within a few days of play, the drawing board doesn't work. There are ""bubbles"" on the drawing screen that don't allow drawing and the ""bubbles"" travel as they press on the screen with the pen. We also have the Magna Doodle-I'd recommend that toy instead. My girls do enjoy getting it out while they watch the show, but it no longer works for them to draw along with Steve."
NEGATIVE	Word of mouth and all the 5-star reviews of this book had me very excited to read this series but... it just wasn't that funny. Nowhere close to Pratchett or Adams, who I find hysterical. The ending was quite depressing. I kept waiting for it to improve (or get funny) on the next page, and it did when I finally finished...
NEGATIVE	Should this thing work on an iMac? I thought so. I still don't know. Anyway, it does not work on my iMac. No sound at all. Who is to blame, Olympus or Amazon or my iMac? I don't know. $20 down the drain. Not worth the trouble to return.
POSITIVE	Laura Stevens provides a much needed road map for parents seeking help for their children with ADHD. By providing step-by-step instructions, sound nutritional knowledge, excellent examples, problem-specific narratives, and good, common sense day-to-day practices (i.e.-recipes), she is eliminating the frustration in the search for answers for current and future parents of children with ADHD. This book provides the type of aid that only could have been given by someone who has had first hand experience in raising children with ADHD. Parents can now learn what to do directly from the book rather than waiting while much of the medical community is playing catch-up to scientific literature.
NEGATIVE	"The code in this edition in so-called C++ is just a copy-and-paste of the C edition code. All the functions have just been made members of ONE ""NR"" CLASS. The code presented brings none of the improvements that C++ could have brought. This turns this book into an ABSOLUTE RIP-OFF...Once again, this would only be useful for the explaination of the algorithms since the code in the C edition is a rather inefficient transcription of Fortran into C."
NEGATIVE	I am now almost completely through the entire book and need to post a review about the translation. While many reviews tout the excellence of the translation, I believe the translation is actually sub-par. I feel the paragraphs are choppy, and the sentences don't flow into each other. In addition, there are multiple spelling errors, including spelling one character's name incorrectly - multiple times within a single paragraph! These are simple things an editor could have fixed...
POSITIVE	I have read three of Butler's books, the Parable of the Sower, Clay's Ark and Wild Seed. This is my third favorite. Butler is an imaginative and masterful writer. I continue to be impressed by her.
POSITIVE	Nintendogs is quite good - but it can get a bit boring. the graphics are good and the touch screen is brill!
POSITIVE	Break out the tissues if you plan to read Anne Lebrecht's heartrending coming of age story, Memories of a Forgotten Past!When Janet Sellman returns to live with the father she never knew, at age fifteen, after ten years in a Catholic boarding school, things are uncomfortable, to say the least. As she slowly rebuilds her life, Janet finds herself troubled by memories she can not begin to deal with or understand. Alone and afraid, she is befriended by Seymour, and older man who makes her feel loved and protected. Janet is happy for the first time in her life. When a tragic accident takes Seymour's life, just days before their wedding, Janet must pick up the pieces of her shattered existence once again. Tears of sorrow became tears of joy as I followed Janet, step by step, on her journey to fulfillment and self discovery. Beautiful!
POSITIVE	I grew up drinking coconut water and often with some 'flesh' in it as well. It was usually served frozen as a icy treat or served chilled.Coconut water has taken a buzz in the news in the past few years due to celebrities and health fads and so I was a bit worried to try this.There were many reviews comparing this brand to others in the market as well.I went with the Vita Coco as it was the most affordable and I liked how it was packaged. I am often on-the-go and so I need something that can easily transport.The taste is good and it really has no sugar in it. I had tried some Dole Pineapple juice a few days earlier and it was just too sweet for my taste.It's refreshing & also has a good taste. Highly recommend!
POSITIVE	When i started reading Hawkes Harbor, i wasn't too terribly impressed. But get past the beginning and it gets good fast. Its an incredible story and I do recommend reading it.
NEGATIVE	The cable that runs between the L and R earphones develops an intermittent connection within weeks of purchase or repair. I own 4 pairs and they're all bad at the moment! I've spent over $60 getting these repaired over and over again but they continue to go bad. It doesn't matter how durable and solid the construction is if you use a poor quality cable. I never used to have a problem with the cable, just in the last 2-3 years or so since they switched from a glossy cable to a matte cable. Surely I'm not the only one with this issue. In any case I'll be selling mine after getting them repaired again.
POSITIVE	This movie is rated R for a reason . You don't like bad langue don't watch it . You don't like sex don't watch it . The people who dont like the movie dont understated why its so dirty and raunchy. Its not meant for old people with high morals or children . I understand the whole kid having sex with teacher thing is bad and illegal. Its a movie if your a person who finds acts of sex, crude humor and all around adult material deplorable Dont watch this movie if your a person who finds Grandmas boy funny you Should enjoy this crazy movie.PSVanilla Ice is hilarious
POSITIVE	I laughed non-stop throughout the movie. A combination of sex, action, car chases and shoot outs, the likes you've never seen!Not a kid's movie, but nonwadays, what is?I salute the writers for their story, the producers for having the courage to make this movie and the rest of the crew that helped.GJGFresno, California
NEGATIVE	We were holding out hope that this would live up to its heritage despite the cheesy plot line and the bad reviews... we should have trusted our common sense. Don't bother!
NEGATIVE	I ordered this for my daughters birthday and Amazon delivered right on her birthday. My daughter is a huge Oscar Wilde fan! Unfortunately, the book was full of garbage text. It was printed by General Books the day I ordered it. I then requested a replacement. Once again, it was printed the day I made my request and it contained the exact garbage text that the original order contained. Here is an example of the garbage text that this book contained...(Jk*he$. HeL*) This was all throughout the book. Then half the book looked like some bizarre glossary that didn't even belong to this book. The entire book was worthless both times and I requested a refund. I can't give a proper review on the book as it was unreadable!
POSITIVE	Originally received jar from sister and liked product. It helpswith unwanted facial hair if used regularly also.
NEGATIVE	Seems to be good quality but does not come with any bolts to assemble the stand.
NEGATIVE	"2 stars because it did crush ice, and because the store where I bought it let me bring it back, so I'm not bitter.however:-after the first use, the motor smelled like burned rubber-the glass jar doesn't lock or snugly ""fit"" in the casing when you use the blender - it just sort of sits there flimsily-all those buttons - does anyone know what all of these subjective sounding functions mean, or how many of them - ""mix"" vs. ""blend,"" ""liquefy"" vs. ""purefy,"" - even differ from one another?Keep your 12 buttons and give me an old-fashioned, 1 or 2 speed, solid kitchen appliance."
POSITIVE	I bought it as a gift for my sister because she likes this movie, and I'm looking forward to her opening it on Christmas!
POSITIVE	"This small paperback is great to carry along while ""hunting,"" but it does not include pictures. What is so good about it is that it's cross-referenced by both pattern and number. So you can look an item up by number if you don't know what pattern it is. I could have just missed it when purchasing, but I did not see a publication date. The copy I got was copyrighted in 2001, so its price list is not too helpful."
POSITIVE	"""The Carnival Bizarre"" is a truly awesome album by one of the greatest heavy metal groups of our time. Called ""A Black Sabbath for the nineties,"" these four guys can spin a tale of witchcraft and destruction that leaves the listener begging for more. In short, if you like heavy metal with an eerie vibe, don't hesitate. Just buy it!!"
POSITIVE	I enjoyed every aspect of this film. I have it on my Kindle where I can watch it any time I want.
NEGATIVE	This DVD is the worst DvD I have. It show you the sun salutation in the most basic way, no down facing dog, no cobra,no ay other options. the first 19 minutes she expleins, the poses so slowly and bored. the 40 minutes after that,she repites he sun salutation over and over with one leg and then the other for the lunges, but what get my so upset isshe does not give you any modification so you can progres, so she is doing it always the same way.Don waste your many on this DVD!!
NEGATIVE	Someone with a military cast of mind seriously interested in the development of the tank and tank tactics will be sorely disappointed. This is more a hagiography for J.F.C. Fuller and an anthology of arcane, English-orientated factoids. Read the 'Publisher Weekly Review' very carefully, particularly the last half. It may save you money and frustration.
POSITIVE	KEISHA IS A TOTAL PACKAGE.FORGIVE ME FOR OVERSTATING HER BUT THIS ALBUM IS THE BOMB.THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT SHE BASHES DUDES ONE 2 MANY TIMES ON HER SONGS
NEGATIVE	This looks like a better deal than it REALLY is, and I wonder how many people who actually did the math for themselves would truly be pleased.This product is listed as 64 ounces, for a cost of $39.75, and they break it down as $0.41 per ounce. This would be a fantastic deal.HOWEVER, $39.75 for 64 ounces means this costs over $0.62 per ounce! This is not cool. I'm not sure if this was done intentionally, but it's bad business.
POSITIVE	This c.d has the best beats out of any underworld c.d I've ever listened to. This is one of thier best but I wouldn't recommend it to a first time listener because some of the songs are pretty abstract. I'd recommend getting dubnobasswithmyheadman or second toughest in the infants first. If you already listen to underworld than this is c.d for you.
POSITIVE	I have been using a knee band like this for the last 6 years. My old ones finally wore out so I replaced them with exactly the same brand. It is great for knee problems, especially chondromalcia patella. I am a regular runner and don't ever run without my knee bands in place.
POSITIVE	I love the playful yet detailed quality of the illustrations and the cute storyline with phrases on each page for children to exclaim together.I felt the story was a little long, though I'm not sure what I would have taken out. And I felt the brightness/contrast of the illustrations could have been tweaked a bit to make the pages less dark. But overall I was very pleased with this book.
NEGATIVE	I recently purchased this fryer from a club store.I did every thing according to the book, the fryer light out when oil at set temp.,used Name brand french fries,.........Soggy! Left nextbatch in 5 min. longer(doubled the time) crispy but GREASY!!(used mazola corn oil)Tried various products hoping this thing would some how start working NOT .It also has a awkward, dangerous style lid,I do not recommend!What attracted me to this fryer was its capacity and the ease of cleaning, and that it is , but that's all.
NEGATIVE	I was surprised to have received this propaganda leaflet disguised as a book in the mail. it turned out a few Jewish friends of mine have received it as well. It arrived with an impersonal spam-like letter that spoke about some divine inspiration the author experienced in a dream..Sid Roth, keep your dreams to yourself, they belong with you in your bed. How dare the publishers send out a cheep proselytizing brochure to people's homes and mask it as an inspired work of literature.This should be illegal
POSITIVE	On A Mission is a fresh and fun form of country music.It allows younger fans to hear what real country music sounds like.The collaboration with Willie Nelson allows older generations to relate to Trick Pony's music.Overall On A Mission is a cd that will brighten your day and put smile on your face for a while.
POSITIVE	I'm just starting out learning about investing. This is the second book about money I read. I really enjoyed reading it and learned a lot. It's a great book for a beginner who wants to know more. If that's you, you'll be satisfied after you read it. I was. Now I can't wait to find more investing books. I have a big stack that I'm already reading. I'll keep this one on my bookshelf to look at again and again, though.
POSITIVE	I haven't been disappointed. It heats up quickly enough. I like that you can use tap water instead of distilled water and the steam feature works very well.
NEGATIVE	This book was quite good the description was good but the action and excitement. Not a very good bargain. We Read it in English at my School
POSITIVE	I own every one of these, and they are ALL worth a read. Beware- do NOT read if you like old fashioned, slow horror with no sex! These are definitely not for the meek or shy.
POSITIVE	"I liked ""reclaim"" so much I'll leave another 5 stars! Read it folks. If you ""claim to be a witch"", you should have no problems with this book.Swamp Witch of the SouthThe operative word here is ""witch"". IF you're a witch you will learn from this book.Belinda"
POSITIVE	"I came across this via Listmania entry, neatly wrapped with Aphex Twin and Thom York. So I said, ""Hey, that looks sexy."" And it was.Each track offered something unique and rich with a characteristic all its own. The trick with this style of music is to make it compelling enough to be addictive, a promise Advokat actually delivers.Scattered throughout the past couple of weeks, since listening to this album, certain tracks keep bubbling up from out of my subconscious, intruding synapses and forcing me to tap fingers and feet. The formula is that it isn't formulaic, and the patterns/beats have an unnerving quality that is both beautiful and compulsive. It's really that good.I'm highly anticipating the next release."
NEGATIVE	No citations. This book is very readable, but entirely too revisionist to be truthful. Zinn is more interested in his class perspective than in actually portraying history. There are far better one volume histories out there. If you are a college student taking American History 101, this book should give you the right perspective to get that B or better term paper.An easy prose style does not a great history book make.
NEGATIVE	DO NOT buy this product if your dog is large or has strong jaws.I am always searching for good chewing toys for our 1 year old Great Dane. (Note that she is in the lower 10th size percentile for Great Danes, so she's not even that monstrously large or strong.)She was able to crush this bone into hundreds of tiny sharp pieces within minutes of chewing.Also, the product was very greasy and left grease stains on her dog bed.I had purchased three, but I threw the other two away with the collection of splinters from the first.
NEGATIVE	"Even though I like a lot of the songs on here, 'Now' should change their title to 'Then.' ""Hey Ya"" is awesome but it is SUCH an old song-they could have put it on Now 14 or even Now 13. I hate the way Now puts songs that are like several months to a year old on their discs. I mean, don't call it 'Now' if it's not what's happening 'now'!! They should try to get their hands on the MOST recent stuff-they should have had Ashlee Simpson's ""Pieces Of Me,"" Outkast's ""Roses"" (hate that song but it's more recent than ""Hey Ya""), Britney Spears's ""Outrageous,"" and songs that we were hearing on the radio when this was released. I am glad they included ""Move Ya Body,"" ""My Band,"" ""The Reason,"" ""Dip It Low,"" and a few others because those are more recent. But....NOW, next time try to get the radio hits we're hearing NOW!"
POSITIVE	these speakers are wonderful! and adorable! my only gripe is that they're fairly lightweight and if the sound is up loud, they tend to rumble right off my shelf. and although i do wish they went a little louder, they're pretty stellar for the size and price.
NEGATIVE	Jonathan Feldman has done a good job at putting together a reasonably entertaining and fairly easy read here. The problem with it is that there are far too many errors, and the information that IS correct is not explained very well. My learning and experience as a CCNA gave me a solid understanding of most of this material, fortunately. I bought this book for a quick review of the major exam objectives, which it provided well enough. My previous knowledge, however, made apparent the very large gaps, lack of explanation or background, and relatively poor concept treatment contained in this book. Bottom line: If you have a firm knowledge of networking already, this book may be a humorous and quick review of the salient points. However, if you already are that prepared, there's nothing you will gain from this book anyway. For the less experienced, I'm afraid the information contained in Mr. Feldman's guide will ony serve to confuse. There are better guides available.
NEGATIVE	Do NOT buy this video if you are looking for a long and endurance type of workout! The dvd is only 15 minutes max in length and it shows you the basics of the workout and I was not even sweating or breathing hard! Then after MaDonna gets done showing you the basic 15 minutes, you see her and her dancers show off each others skill in dancing. BORING!
NEGATIVE	"Have not even bothered to use it, just returning. It is supposed to ""lock"" into place to give you a 90o cut guide, but the alignment holes are off for the dimples that are suppose to fit in the holes, so it never ""locks"" into place. The only way I would trust that is was square would be to use a right angle to check for square. Mine was hard to set at 90o using just my hands (does not rotate smoothly). However, when using it, it would be easy for the saw to push it slightly out of alignment because there is no way to lock it at a set angle.Elimination of the 90o alignment holes/dimples and the addition of some kind of real lock that was accurate would be good."
NEGATIVE	I received this cage as a Christmas gift from my Sister who meant well but unfortunately it didn't work out. The plastic on this unit is very lightweight and the door comes off very easily. I don't like the snap on features to hold the carrier together as they have opened up on me several times. The real big issue is the door. It does not stay in place and falls out of the mounting holes I have a Sheltie that is around 14lbs and this does not even support her. This is not a large cage as advertised but a medium one. Bottom line, if you just want a cage in the house that will remain stationary, get it but don't transport with it. I recommend this cage very highly:http://www.amazon.com/Petmate-Kennel-Fashion-Bleached-Peacock/dp/B00063KG64/ref=sr_1_2?s=pet-supplies&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1299996956&sr;=1-2If you can find it in a large or medium, it will do the job and not fall apart.
NEGATIVE	One of Gary Daniels' earlier movies, this turgid and inept bomb is poorly lit, poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed. Daniels, who has improved considerably over the years, is very bad in this one, about as convincing as a toddler in this role. The supporting cast, which also includes a pointless David Carradine, is also awful. The fight scenes are so obviously staged, you can almost see the actors counting their moves. A real loser!
NEGATIVE	When I was growing up, I'd watch the Superfriends on TV. One of my favorite characters was Hal Jordan. While I never read comics as a child, I found new interest in reading them during the Death of Superman storyline. Once again, Hal Jordan played a big role in the storyline. I decided to pick up the book and happened to start right at the beginning of Emerald Twilight. I was horrified. Hal turned into a mass murderer, killing his trusted friends and stealing the power battery's power. While I liked his replacement, Kyle Rayner, I grew to understand the importance that Hal Jordan held in the GL mythos. Emerald Twilight was a travesty.
NEGATIVE	It was probably the most confusing book I have ever tried to read. I wondered if it really was that confusing or was I just dense, so I looked up some reviews. It is, by all accounts, very confusing with the jumps in time. I don't mind stretching my brain a little to read a book, it doesn't have to be just pure entertainment, but trying to follow the characters and the jumping back and forth in time and place was just more work than it was worth. I gave up after the first part. I know it is supposed to be one of the best books ever written which is why I chose to read it in the first place, but I'm not willing to work that hard to figure out what the author is trying to say. I'm not a college professor, just a reasonably bright guy who likes to get some enjoyment as well as a learning experience from reading.
NEGATIVE	"I watched this movie because I was curious to see one of Brad Pitt's earliest roles and I like horror movies, especially those from the 80s. Well, Pitt was in it and it was a horror movie, but I can't say anything good about this movie. It was not funny, the acting was very bad, and it was not scary in the slightest bit. And the dialogue? Now there's something scary. Whether viewed as a ""serious"" slasher flick or a parody (parodies are supposed to be funny), it just plain sucked.I can't understand this movie getting positive reviews, unless it's due to Brad Pitt being in it. If you're not interested in seeing his early work, stay away. You have been warned."
POSITIVE	I bought this case for my Canon 700 in advance of a scuba trip to the Carribean. The case worked marvelously!! You can access every button on the camera while diving and I took the case down to 75' with no leaks or problems at all. I took over 500 pictures underwater while diving during the week and they came out really well. You can even take underwater movies using the camera's movie function. Alhtough this case is a bit pricey, it is worth every penny!
NEGATIVE	This mini kettle makes your water taste like plastic. I'm not sure how the others have managed to drink from it. I've tried boiling it out a number of times, but the strong plastic scent and taste remain. That can't be good for you. Also, the cord is extremely short so expect you will need an extension unless you put it right next to the plug. Unfortunately, I will be returning this.
NEGATIVE	Forget it. I'm going to the used bookstore.I just won't pay more for an electronic version than for a paper version.
POSITIVE	The book is about WWII battles in the 1940's. Veterans tell their stories about what happend on a quiet Sunday morning. The Americans hear roaring engines and don't know what the noise is, until it's too late. Pearl Harbor is pounded by Japanese fighter planes. The American troops are unaware and lose several thousand air planes and a few ships. Later in the war America dropped two nuclear bombs on Japan ending the war in the Pacific. In Europe America had another problem. The Nazi's of Germany were killing Jews for no reason but hatred. Working with the European troops they finally stopped the war. I enjoyed this book because it gave me more information about WWII. It's really interesting to hear the differnt stories about the American troops and how the war started and ended.
POSITIVE	Roy uses similes, metaphors, snatches of sentences to create a beautiful, intricate tale. She keeps the reader guessing by alluding to crimes still to come and past tragedies not yet explained. Her subject matter covers the gamut from sexual abuse, police corruption, parental neglect, and the horrifying results of the caste system. It is a difficult book to read but well worth the effort.
NEGATIVE	This isn't literature in my humble opinion. This is moneymaking gimmickery that, unfortunately, I have now contributed to. Anyone want to by a slightly used book?
POSITIVE	To judge this cd means to judge it only based on lyrics, beat, content, and flow. I believe for his first album he has much talent. With time he will be the bomb! I will buy this at the first chance I get. I love several of the songs on the album. When you can dig more than five songs on an album these days you got a legitimate cd. Keep doing your thing man. The cd is grooving. Can't wait for the second one.
NEGATIVE	terrible so called account of the Italian campaign in WW2 is actually a long boring diatribe against the germans which continues on almost every page, while glorifying the brave heroic italians which literally made me laugh out loud! it was a gift so i did'nt pay for it but free is still too much. avoid at all costs..much better books on the subject available but none worse
NEGATIVE	If you're a gamer or a graphic designer, look elsewhere. The power saving function of the mouse makes it shut off until it feels motion. So if you're not using the mouse for just a little bit, it powers down and waits for movement.It's a very ergonomic mouse, with responsive buttons and nice LED indicators, but if it can't let you move around the screen when you need it to it's not much more than a (bad) paperweight. Move along.
NEGATIVE	The problem with the Tassimo machine is it's design and quality. The first problem is that it sounds like a jet plane taking off when it brews a cup of coffee. I wish I were exaggerating, but it is a VERY loud machine. The other major problem is that it leaks almost as much water into the drip cup as the single cup of coffee it produces. This is especially problematic if the cup you are using does not fit onto the platform. You are then forced to place the coffee mug into the drip cup with the leaking water . Ingenious design! The quality of the coffee it produces is good, but the hassle with the noise and water only allow me to give it 2 stars. There are better products on the market.
NEGATIVE	My 3 year old could not wait to be Mickey Mouse for Halloween. The day we got this costume was such a disappointment!! We ordered the size Child S (4-6x). My son wears a size 4 or 5 in regular clothes. This costume was so snug (with only a t-shirt and underwear on) - and the hat was so small, my guess is it would only fit a baby. He wasn't happy, but we had to return it. So sad. I should have read the other reviews about the size discrepency before I ordered it.
POSITIVE	I have been using Gabel's Bay Rum for many years now; there is just nothing else like it. I tried other rum oil after shaves and each case I was disappointed. They all burned like alcohol on an open wound and they all lacked that just from the barbers shop smell. I have sensitive skin, so I have tried every new product sold, so believe me when I say Gabel's Bay Rum does not clog pores, leave an oily feel or film, nor does it promote acne. Short of have a prescription shaving product, Gabel's Bay Rum after shave and Neutrogena Skin Clearing Shave Gel are the best products going.
NEGATIVE	This is a piece of junk. It did work, but very crappy sound quality. $1.61 plus S/H = $4.59 what a waste of money. I should have brought the Sony for just $12
POSITIVE	I watched this production on Masterpiece Theater and the only bad thing about it was that it was divided into three parts, with the result that I was on the edge of my seat for three weeks. At that time I had not read the novel, but did read it after watching this production. This film was beautifully produced, well-written, well-acted and just purely exciting. It is the best movie I have seen in a long time, on TV or in the theater. These characters are some of the most marvelous Dickens ever created, ranging from eccentric (Silas Wegg) to just plain odd (Mr. Venus) and from very good (Lizzie) to terrifying (Bradley Headstone). This movie has it all: greed, lust, madness, evil, innate goodness, love, romance, and mystery.
NEGATIVE	"I have most of the 500 series and have been very please with the variety of artists and styles that were covered. This particular title should have been ""Artists celebrate the anguish of the human form"". The majority of work illustrates very tortured forms and very few made me want to celebrate.I can appreciate the diversity of techniques and interpretations covered in the book, but it is heavily biased toward the disfigured and tortured. A few more celebrated forms would have made the book more balanced - as the other 500 series have been."
NEGATIVE	"BALLROOM DANCING - Chris Kalogerson & OrchestraExperienced ballroom dancers, read no further--this CD is not for you. The tempo on most of these selections is painfully slow, suitable for beginner's practice. One can almost hear the dancer counting ""1-2-3"" in the waltz (85 BPM), or ""slow-slow-quick-quick"" on the fox-trots. The Latin selections lack the fire and energy associated with this type music. On the two rumba selections (Spanish Eyes & Day in the Life of a Fool) the tempo is OK. On the cha-chas the rhythm is understated, and difficult for an inexperienced dancer to follow. A tip-off should be that this CD has ""Dance Instructions Enclosed."" Descriptions of the basic step of seven dances (with numbered foot-diagrams) is enclosed. A novelty is the inclusion of the ""Butterfly"" dance word-description. Track # 8, ""Little Brown Jug,"" is labeled ""Butterfly,"" and has the expected repeated changes of tempo from 3/4 to 2/4."
NEGATIVE	It's too juvenile. For a younger audience perhaps or maybe in the day it came out it was more suited. I love a lot of these type of movies but this one let me down. It's on the pile to re-sell. Think bubble gum.
POSITIVE	Definitely characterizes hartford's more creative and abstract side. Somewhat more of a novelty though. It's enjoyable if youre really into his strange side.
NEGATIVE	"A book on poker tells that is a useful companion to Mike Caro's definitive ""Book of Tells""."
NEGATIVE	These charcoal incense cones do not stay lit. They burn for about one minute, then go out every time. I even tried putting lighter fluid on them (carefully) and once the fluid burned off, the cones still quickly stopped burning.
POSITIVE	George Romero's name goes a long way with undead/zombie fans.This movie is not part of the other films, but it is a step out of time, but it still has biting social commentary (pardon the pun.) The acting is not great, but it's a fun story, if your style of fun is watching zombies killing everybody they can.
POSITIVE	I've read this, and continue to use it as a reference. While it has a breadth of information useful for planning, what I really missed is a very detailed list of shelf-life for various foods. There are generalized numbers for general food categories, but I'd like much more. If you are truly planning for an emergency, you'll need more than just this book.
NEGATIVE	"Hmmm. The title, ""Genesis Songbook"" should provide some guidance to the buyer shouldn't it? It did not and I am very bitter about what appears to be an interview documentary interspersed with songclips and a few singles. I have been a dedicated fan for years and had high expectations. I have had those expectations met with the DVD releases by Seve Hackett their former guitarist. There must be something better out there. The interviews were fine but not I have not a single urge to watch it again."
NEGATIVE	the light isn't very bright.. the plastic is kinda cheaply made.. it requires a special light bulb.. i don't know why amazon removed my previous review. i returned the product.
NEGATIVE	"Kevin Costner have made a crime against humanity. The real mistery to me are those numerous ""patriotic"" Americans who suport this attack on mental health. God save America from Costner because Allah probably won't..."
POSITIVE	much better than the first, in this album puffy goes deeper into his mind----expresses true thoughts--- tight rymes----and really proves that he is one of the best there ever was---!!! Puff Daddy Could Live -------------------- F O R E V E R ------------------
POSITIVE	We have this in a tank with a baby yellow-bellied slider and a few fish. It is preset at 78 degrees, and keeps our water around 78 - 80 degrees all the time. The lowest I have seen it drop is to 76 degrees. Our turtle has really come alive since we inserted the heater, and he spends a lot of time in the water chasing fish and diving. He is so much happier now!
POSITIVE	256 colors is only 8 bits of color, so you weren't even setting your color settings right. No wonder it didn't work for you!
NEGATIVE	"Rubes, in short, has the same style as Gary Larson's legendary ""Far Side"" comics, except for one fatal flaw: rubes isn't funny. Each panel is like an iron stake being driven into my brain. After reading the entire book, I chuckled maybe once. The comics are based on the corniest of jokes, but their not even jokes really. They're just awful puns. Here, let me make up a Rubes cartoon. The caption is ""Cat got your tongue?"" and the picture is literally of a guy with a cat holding on to his tongue. Hopefully Leigh Rubin won't sue me, because he probably came up with that one already. Don't buy this book, don't look at the book, don't even mention this book, because mentioning it makes it slightly useful, which this book is not."
POSITIVE	Ideal for those planning a visit to this remote place, Zeppa's book smoothly introduces you to a diverse culture, providing many hints on customs and daily life, all in a colloquial (and sometimes amusing) tone. She is always respectful of others (not sacrificing some constructive critic in the way). Many would wish for this book to have been longer.
NEGATIVE	Being at Bonnaroo 2003 was nothing sort of awsome! Best festival of the year! It is too bad this 2 cd set doesnt do the festival justice. It seems like they only picked artists that would help them sell the cd better to people who werent there. Artist like James Brown, Jack Johnson, Jason Mraz and Ben Harper are very weak compared to some they skiped such as Moe., Neil Young, North Mississippi Allstars, Spearhead, and The Wailers. Also A lot of the songs they picked are not the best from each artists shows, like The Dead's Sugar Magnolia and Widespread Panic's Papa Johnny Road. my advice is dont buy this cd you will not be happy with it, if you are into jamband music your better off trading for live shows from the weekend.
POSITIVE	Electricians out there know this is a safe product. It is also much better and better price than Greenlee. Greenlee just doesn't do anything. I have been using this product for too many years to count. For those of you that the job tells you to put away the pocket knife for safety reasons. Then this is what your looking for.
POSITIVE	THIS CD CHANGER IS GREAT I'VE HAD ONE IN MY CAR FOR 15 YEARS. BUT THE ONE I GOT THROUGH YOU GUYS WAS DEFECTIVE AND WHOLESALE AV DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER ONE , SO I HAD TO BUY IT SOMEWHERE ELSE MY ACCOUNT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CREDITED ACCORDINGLY. THANK YOU KEITH STEINKE
POSITIVE	"I had been part of a couple of technology startups before I was lucky enough to have taken Steve Blank's class and read his book, and his Customer Development process is right on point. The process is THE way to reduce the biggest risk outside of your startup's control: customer/market risk.It's a methodical, testable, measurable approach to what has historically been more of an art than a science: guessing what your customers want. More than that, it's accessible - the process is broken down into achievable chunks and can be adopted for almost any idea.This book is required reading for the founding team of our new startup, and every time we ""lose our way"" we go back to the hypotheses pegged to the wall. I can't recommend it highly enough."
POSITIVE	I really enjoyed this book. I couldnt believe how it just really pointed out features that are right out there in front of you. Im so glad I took the time to buy and read this book.
NEGATIVE	I love the magazine but the customer service sucks. I ordered the magazine in April 2010; knowing that I would not receive my first edition for 6-8 weeks. So I purchased the May, June, and July edition at the news stand. I received the May issue on June 30 and the June issue on July 7, 2010. I called customer service explaining that I already purchased the May, June, and July issues. They told me that they would only extend my subscription for one month (until May 2011). I thought this was very poor of them. I am getting really tired of talking to someone overseas.
POSITIVE	"I got this product for my birthday. I expected the baby penguin to be at least 5""or 4"" tall, instead it was 3.5"". It can fit in my palm. The Mom is a foot tall. They are very easy to cut apart the baby from the Mom. They are: soft, realistic, cuddly and well made.Over all I will give it five stars. [ I am 9]"
POSITIVE	"""Overflowing with color photographs of families from around the world, this book tells of the delights and experiences that can result from knowing more than one language. Schwalm, a specialist in early childhood education, wrote the book to help develop an appreciation and respect for second-language learners.The book begins with how to learn a second language, then focuses on five bilingual children in their day-to-day experiences. There is also a colorful list of more than 600 languages to emphasize the breadth of diversity in the world. The children featured in this book speak English as well as Spanish, Hmong, and Tagalog. This book could also be enlightening for English-only speaking children who live in a community with many bilingual people."""
POSITIVE	This is a great book! Four orphans afraid of their grandfather settle down in an abandoned boxcar. Their names are: Benny, Violet, Jessie, and Henry. When Violet gets hurt they take her to the doctor and discover how kind their grandfather really is.This book is of a series so if you like this one there are many more. These four chidren solve mysteries with their dog in future books.
POSITIVE	This was an excellent manual that served as my bike-side mate for several years. Without this thing I would have wasted hours and hours taking apart the wrong the assemblies, without the proper tools. I'm a big fan. Oh, and the specified reference metrics at the end are great.I recommend, no questions asked.http://www.littlebean.org/afteralex/
POSITIVE	This is my all-time favorite movie/musical. I love it! I know all the songs by heart. When I was ten, I danced around our family room to the vinyl record until it was all scratched up until every song skipped (you now have to be a certain age to get that). Anyway, it was my favorite movie and still is. Everyone in your family will enjoy this movie, but if you have a little girl-this is the movie she must have because it's the best version of Cinderella she'll ever hear and funny too! And, if you're lucky, this movie may become one of those perfect childhood memories- it sure is one of mine.
POSITIVE	This is handy to have around. I have used it on many sliding objects...closet doors, glass doors, etc. Works great.
POSITIVE	I recently purchased two of these arbors. We recently had 65 mile an hour winds. They lasted for almost an hour. We also had heavy down pours and large hail stones. When it was over my arbors stood tall. The tree next door didn't. I have too highly recomend this product.
NEGATIVE	This pool looked great as it was being inflated. However, I was very disappointed to find that it had no drain plug. A pool this size is very heavy and difficult to drain by hand. The bottom developed a leak after just a few weeks of use. Definitely not recommended.
POSITIVE	heard them on Pandora and purchased them, because they are all great sounds.this irritates me...stop making me say more than I want to.
NEGATIVE	not good, although some funny parts. my wife found it slightly better. end was best part. story is unclear from the beginning
NEGATIVE	"I don't want to diss anyone who likes this game, but I can't really see much good in this game. The graphics are not really anything speical. It seems almost impossible to see the enemy and you find your self being shot and you can't see the enemy until you've had a major loss of life. The control is rather overly complicated and isn't exactly user freindly. The sound is okay, but it seems to make you a little tence. The game is near impossible even on easy difficultys. I have owned the game for quite a long time and still haven't beaten the first level by myself. The missons seem a bit vague and you think ""okay... what the heck do I do now?"" too often. When I play this, I can't help but get frustrated and it always feels like the game's fault..... Even if you are in to army stuff, you might want to rent this first. If this is your kind of thing, I recomend Medal of Honor: Underground or Syphon Filter."
NEGATIVE	As the title states the product arrived too late for its intended purpose despite being ordered in plenty of time . The company did not even apologize or offer a lame excuse.
NEGATIVE	Considering my first introduction to WICKED was the music, I eagerly looked forward to the book. The first page should have told me not to pay full price for this piece of ranting, vulgar junk. I can't believe that anyone could or would make such a great musical out of this book - and that is the nicest thing I can say about the book. DISAPPOINTING!
POSITIVE	"I was possibly one of the worst cooks on the planet until I discovered Giada De Laurentiis and bought 'Giada's family dinners' book. It truly inspired me to enjoy not only the cooking but also the preparation of the food. It's georgously glossy with lots of lovely photos and the recipes are so simple to follow that I have so far failed to produce a disastrous result which in itself is a small miracle. All of the ingredients used are easily available. The suggested menus are also a great idea especially for someone who needs all the help I can get. One of my favourite recipes is the Lasagna Rolls and whoever heard of grilling lettuce? - but it works! I would also recommend Giada's ""Everyday Italian"" book for all the same reasons plus the fact that the Vodka Sauce is heavenly. Thank you Giada, I'm no longer scared of the kitchen!"
POSITIVE	Full metal jacket is a bright loud well made well acted brilliant look at the Vietnam war. The characters are unforgetable. The story is realistic and accurate. i like it better than Platoon and Apocalypse now. The boot camp part sets it apart and the Vietnam part is briliant.
NEGATIVE	Sony Online Entertainment continues to ignore their player base and put out bug ridden patches and updates to the existing game making it worse and worse. Customer service is terrible and arrogant if you can ever even get a reply to your questions. The game was once great but is now a mess.If you want to play a good MMORPG go buy World of Warcraft, the developers 'Blizzard' have an amazing reputation and are constantly 'in touch' with their player community.
NEGATIVE	I live smack in the middle of tornado alley. For the past week we have gone under severe thunderstorm watches and warnings as well as tornado watches. I belong to a weather blog as well as being a stormchaser. I bought a Midland hoping to be able to warn my daughter of danger when I was at work. Since buying it four months ago ( I know it is programmed correctly) it has correctly gone off once out of about 12 alert times.According to my weather friends theirs sit silent as well. There are 15 of us on my weather blog who have Midlands and no ones has gone off, including today for the tornado watch over Kansas City. We can't all be programming incorrectly. Luckily, we have other venues for weather tracking so I try to have someone call my daughter to alert her as we can not trust the Midlands at all. Biggest waste of money ever!
NEGATIVE	The synopsis from the other reviews are accurate. The feud between the families is really one-sided as the main family keeps getting duped and manipulated by the other - over and over and over again for generations. There are a few laughs and some tiny victories but they are too few and far between. There is a bit of pay-off/resolution finally at the end, but I'm not sure it was worth all the tedium. I feel that the author communicates the characters' emotion well. However, the writing style can be difficult to follow. Sometimes within the same paragraph the setting and focal character changes with no transition. It will jump like this often. The book's voice is in the present, but he speaks almost in 1st person while following the chronology of 4 generations. I enjoyed the bits of cinema history, but again, not really worth the time.
NEGATIVE	Not only are the screws not part of the cap like the OEM part, but the plastic is very cheap. Mine broke when tightening the screws. I will return this cap and get an OEM replacement. I should have known not to buy a German part for a Japanese car.
POSITIVE	I just finished The Brethren, and I really enjoyed it! I have never read one of John Grisham's books before, and I have heard that this was definitely not one of his best. However, as much as I enjoyed this one, I look very forward to reading more of his books. It was interesting, and the plot was fascinating to me. You wanted to read to the end, to see what would happen.
NEGATIVE	This was supposed to be a Christmas present. It came on the 23rd. When I opened the package, the infuser was chipped. Now I have to pay shipping fees to return it. And most importantly, I don't have a gift I was planning to give. Very disappointed.
NEGATIVE	I think the title of this review made my review. The game is really short! I'm just warning you! Even though it's fun to play around as a dog, it isn't worth $20 for it! It might be worth $5, but it isn't. Trust me. Don't think I'm a conartist, because I'm not. I hope I saved you $20 dollars. Thank you for listening to my warning, even though you probally didn't even believe me, because I heard almost the same exact thing from someone else, and I didn't even bother.
NEGATIVE	Unfortunately the original American Reunion should have been a one hit wonder. Perhaps there are too many egos in the way and really Stiffler's Mom was the true talent here.
POSITIVE	This album is really unique. I have loved N.E.R.D. forever. Now i wont lie at first when i heard this i wasn't really use to the whole rock thing. But now that i listen more and more it grew on me. Give this album a chance tru hip hip lovers who are use to grimey give this a chane. This album is GREAT i love it. Hot tracks...Drill Sergeant, Jump, The Way She Moves, Fly Or Die, and Thrasher. If your expecting the style of the first album you might not like this it's nothing like the first album, this is more new age rock no rap on this album. But it's still great
NEGATIVE	The concept for this book is one of those that probably looked great when he was outlining it. But hundreds of pages about some fledging kingdom did not interest me considering the previous four SOT novels. But I soldiered through hoping for some payoff in the end. What I got was robbed,ripped off and cheated.If you are hoping this kingdom plays a future role in the fate of the D'Haran Empire? Don't :(If you are hoping Richard finds some clever way to defeat or dispel the Chimes. Don't :(If you are hoping Richard has some awesome battle with a powerful wizard. Don't :(The ending was such a paste-on that I'm left wondering who really wrote it.At the end of the day, you can skip this book and miss very little in plot advancement. That's the real tragedy of it all.
NEGATIVE	I purchased this for a research paper on the Bush Doctrine, and it had nothing to do with the Doctrine. I'm not sure it even mentioned it. Unless you know NOTHING about just war theory, this really skims the very basics and isn't helpful at all if you any knowledge in F.P. or I.R. It really isn't even helpful for strengthening arguments or prior research, don't waste your money.
NEGATIVE	Ok I do admit that some of their (N'Sync's) songs get stuck in my head and I'm not here to bash them. BUT. . . these guys were brought together by some rich guy and given voice lesson and taught to dance. Notice in all these BOY BANDS there's usually. . 1)The older one 2)the young baby face 3)two that are related 4)the kinda weird one 5)the HOT one 6)and the bad boyThese bands are prototypes they haven't played together for years AND EARNED their success (like Rolling Stones, Dave Matthews, REM) I just hope that these guys don't go spending all their money because only the BEATLES have made this formula a success. THANX
POSITIVE	This book is good for people who enjoy reading about WW2. It was a very interesting book about a Lieutenant on a submarine. I enjoyed it very much. WW2 fans wanted. :)
POSITIVE	I think that Piers Anthony is a great writer.When my friend let me read the book I just had to start collecting.So the next day I went out and bought as many Piers Anthony books as I could afford.Now I am a devoted reader and will keep collecting as long as they're out there.
NEGATIVE	I have had my MIU France Bamboo cutting board since July. It is now early January and my board has split in half. Too late to return for a refund, but a $50 board should last longer than 6 months. I did not ever wash it in hot water, just wiped with damp sponge. It sat on a flat surface (a marble top) and was never abused - actually hardly used. Quality is poor!
NEGATIVE	Make sure you really like this item, because I was charged $8 in restocking fees. Not sure where it's mentioned in the product page; I couldn't find it anywhere.
NEGATIVE	We were so excited to find this item because I had been searching for ages to replace the one we had used for years and years manufactured under another name but the cutting blade showed signs of stress and cracking during the first day of use.
NEGATIVE	I think the price of stanley tools has come down a bit over the last few years but unfortanately, the quality of their screw drivers has too. I usually buy multiplew packs because I tend to lose tools easily or just misplace them and then I am stuck.you save decent money with the multipacks also.the problem I have is that the heads of 3 of the screw drivers stripped out prematurely and form medium to heavy use.I am not a big fan any more.
NEGATIVE	I love the original dirty south. 8ball & MJG, Outkast, Goodie Mob and even original Master P. When I found out Gnarls Barkley was Cee-Lo from Goodie Mob. I was very dissappointed. You want to hear Cee-Lo sing, buy that Goodie Mob, Soul Food. I love Outkast and I bought their albums until Stankonia and Speakerboxx. Is this the trend in Hip-Hop and rap, change what has made you successful, to appeal to mainstream?
NEGATIVE	"Poor Robin Moore was completely discredited by this POS called ""Jack"" Idema, whom by the way, was a total fraud, according to those who knew him. ""Jack"" Idema was basically out to make himself look like a hero and basically abused the trust of Mr. Robin Moore. This book is nothing but one egotistic nut job (""Jack"" Idema)'s make believe fiction and readers should not waste their time reading it unless they want to read fiction of what a nut job (""Jack"" Idema) think happen during the early year of the Afghan war.Robin Moore is a good man and his book about the US Army Special Forces was a great book, I am just sorry that his good name got tarnished by a POS called ""Jack"" Idema."
POSITIVE	The moview is briliant and the restoration beyond expectation. I however, did have difficulty playing the 2 extra blue ray discs on my LG blue ray disc player.
NEGATIVE	After having read and enjoyed Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, I was eager to gobble up another title from Sijie. Whereas I was immediately drawn into Balzac, I just couldn't find myself ever getting into the story of Mr. Muo. It just ambled along, with infrequent glimpses of the genius I saw in Balzac. This story never gets off the ground, and the ending was very much a disappointment. Skip this one, read Sijie's first novel instead.
NEGATIVE	"R-KELLY HAD IT ALL...THAT IS UNTIL HE SOLD OUT AND IS TRYING TO PLAY BOTH FIELDS(old school,remember howLUTHER used to be??)IF U WANT A GOOD C.D.THAT TOOK R-KELLY TO THE TOP AND THEN HE DROPED...GO BUY THE ''PUBLIC ANNONCEMENT"""" C.D. THERE U WILL FINDWERE R-KELLY SHOULD OF KEEP WITH!!!AND U WILLHAVE MONEY LEFT OVER TO BUY HIS EARLYER C.D.s WITH THEM...."
NEGATIVE	I purchased this book while on vacation as it looked like a good book to read at the beach. The book reviews on the 1st couple of pages looked great but ...I am sorry I did not open it and read a few pages. It is a book that is full of extremely bad language ...#%*#...not my style. It is not well done. I am tired of authors and movie directors who think the average guy on the street wants this kind of trash...To make matters worse the author teaches college literature. He should know better. this is not literature...pure trash. The College of the Atlantic in Maine can do much better. I cannot believe I am the 1st person to give this book the review it deserves. I would have given it 0 stars if this were an option...If a book full of 4 letter words is your style, go for it. But when your kids start to talk this way- don't blame their friends. I am taking a stand and burning this book instead of trading it at a used book store.
NEGATIVE	with the exception of you put a move on my heart,stuff like that&slow jams this is pretty average.tamia is a way better vocalist than brandy.brandy in fact almost ruins rock with you.quincy jones is the producer of producers genius,legend,etc.. but this isn't with his standards.
POSITIVE	This is in response to Nikki69187@aol.com....There was no mistake made on the Iggy and Rainbow pages. Iggy is not multi-colored he is blue. Rainbow is not blue he is multi-colored. Therefore, whoever made this book did not make a mistake.
POSITIVE	I fell in love with the movie and knew I had to order the book as soon as possible. The item arrived in perfect condition and sooner than expected!
NEGATIVE	I really should've read the reviews on this, but I didn't see how I could go wrong. It's described very well and the pictures really sell it. I think I may have gotten one of the defective ones because the arms that I got did not look like the arms in the instruction booklet. There was not sufficient space and they were too close together in length. Once I put it together, there was no way to fit it onto my table without possibly breaking it or the table. It stuck at a ridiculouly high angle and would not go any further. I hope I have better luck with the next brand I try because I hate the 5' tall rolling highchair that we got as a present. For now, I am content with the bumbo. Amazon is going to take it back as defective and refund me the shipping.
NEGATIVE	The order came on time. Unfortunately this DVD player is the worst piece Ive ever dealt with. From the minute I inserted a movie, the visual was terrible there were lines and dots all over the screen so you culd not even see anything in the movie. The audio was even worse, you could not make out anything. I tried all different ways to see if maybe it was something I was doing wrong but after half an hour of trying different movies and adjusting the menu nothing helped. I was very very disappointed with this order and I would not recomend it to anyone. This is my first order off the internet that I have been disatisfied with. Im still very upset about it.
POSITIVE	Their explanation of different things often does seem overly simplistic even for the general public. Especially when it comes to chemistry. I do think grade school chemistry is at best the standard. It is entertaining and I do learn new things about what you could call astrophysics. ...Oscar
POSITIVE	Anything putting together was fine but I was missing some screws. Other then that everything was fine. I would buy again. but have exta screws.
NEGATIVE	"I put the Sunforce 50012 inside my car's windscreen and plugged it into the cigar lighter. (On this car the cigar lighter is ""live"" even when the ignition is off). The Sunforce 50012 worked for one day. Next day it appeared dead (There is blue LED that blinks when it is working). I picked it up, it started working, sat it down, it quite. Twisted it, it worked, then it didn't, then it did. The old intermitant (sp) connection problem. Basically it was shot, dead, kaput, trash it. Long story short, I fixed it by taking it apart and re-soldering components. I am smart and lucky with nothing better to do. 99.999% of the users could not make this fix. So just forget about it. This thing is garbage."
NEGATIVE	"Every accented character in the book has simply been erased for the Kindle edition. Since there are many such characters, there being many phrases in French and other languages, part of the author's approach for building atmosphere, this indicates a certain carelessness on the part of the editors. In fact a complete lack of quality control.For example, the word ""francais"" (with a cedilla under the 'c') becomes, in this edition, ""franais"".I have got used to seeing errors in Kindle editions, but this is the worst so far. My rating has nothing to do with the quality of the writing, which seems to be great. Just the way that this Kindle edition has been prepared.Come on, Amazon. Do better!"
NEGATIVE	"If you purchase this item ""new"" from Amazon, look carefully to see if it's listed as ""manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media."" The CD itself will be a greenish ""burned"" CD-ROM, not a standard factory-made CD. The burned CD-ROM bears only a generic ""Naxos"" label on it without any identifying album name! And worst of all, there are NO liner notes - none of the excellent scholarly Naxos liner notes that I have come to expect when purchasing their other classical albums. Caveat emptor!"
POSITIVE	After the ok God's son Nasty Nas returns with his nastiest album since stillmatic. Nas unleashes his fury on tracks like nazareth savage, and on these are our heroes, and american way where he discusses how alot of rappers are trying to be political with thier songs. Others highlights include: Suicide Bounce w/Busta Rhymes(Sick ass beat!!!) Virgo w/Ludacris and Doug E. Fresh Beatboxing!!! The Makings of a Perfect B#$%h. Overall this is a hot album from one of the best rappers ever!!!!!
NEGATIVE	I have fine hair therefore; I typically perm my hair twice a year. I used 1/2 of this relaxer and as a result my hair texture changed significantly. I washed my hair repeatedly within the first week thinking I did not remove the entire relaxer but the result was and is the same: coarse, lack luster hair. I can't put any heat on it and no amount of moisturizer can add any life to it. I am extremely disappointed in this product since I have used Dark and Lovely for years! Please heed the warning: DO NOT USE!!!
POSITIVE	I am very satisfied with this product. It matches the honey nursery baskets with sage gingham liner, so if you want to get matching peices then get this along with the baskets. I like that the liner is drawstring, the hamper with the white liner and different colored ribons is not.
NEGATIVE	I had only heard one song by CS and really liked it, December. There is nothing even close to the sound and feel of that song on the rest of this boring album. I don't understand what anybody is raving about if this is the best CS can produce. To those expecting adult/progressive/alternative: forget it! This is pure made-for-the-masses commercial junk food. Give me chance to unload this turkey to someone that can appreciate.
NEGATIVE	"Bought this tent from ""WW Bargains"" expecting a water proof floor! NOT!!! Tent must have a ground barrier or you will be wet!Made contact with seller and had a very disapointing respons! Kinda like, to bad so sad, customer service had a very limited and unacceptableresponse to issue at hand!Partially my fault for not asking the right question before ordering. ALWAYS ask first!I will not be doing business with them again!I will not use, nor recommend using, this tent if wet weather is forcasted; however, it does work very well in dry conditions!Hope this is helpfull and have a great campout!FYI, AMAZON IS FABULOUS!Brad"
POSITIVE	"I read parts of this when I was 8, and was totally fascinated with the Old Testament stories. When I became a Christian 11 years later, this was the first ""Bible"" I read through. To this day, all the stories are vivid in my mind, and it has helped me to bring to life the same stories when I read the real texts. I bought this Bible for my daughter, and she has been glued to it for days. We also had a copy before she was reading, and she just loved to look at the pictures and ask questions. This is a great book to read to familiarize yourself with many of the Bible's stories and history. Great for new believers and young readers. It is not word-for-word with the Bible, and does take a little dramatic license here and there, but overall it's pretty good."
POSITIVE	Walden, was just excellent. Even better than I thought it would be. Looks new. Very pleased.Thank you for sending it off so fast...
NEGATIVE	I too wish I had read reviews of this book before wasting my money. I was about to board a train for a 3 hour ride and wanted something to read. Even so, I put it down after a couple of chapters. I eventually finished it in a moment of madness. It reminds me of someone's (not very good) 8th grade English project - zero imagination, zero feeling for Jane Austen's style. A complete waste of time.
NEGATIVE	My son (22 mos) is totally enamoured with Curious George. I purchased this toy and he did, in fact, really like it. However, I don't really like the material used to make this toy. It isn't really that soft and he isn't as squishy as you might want him to be. The construction is also pretty shoddy. He was sporting numerous holes after only about a month. I would suggest buying a doll put out by a different company instead. Don't buy this one.
NEGATIVE	just looking that the preview that's available i can already tell that this is a bad book. some of the drawings look like kindergarten drawings or chicken scratch. stay away from this book.
POSITIVE	I was getting really tired of wearing socks from the Big box stores (Walmart, Target, Old-Navy). My problems with them were mostly the same. After awhile they would keep falling down my leg. The elastic wasn't strong or wore out fast. When I first saw these on Amazon, I remember my father had these many years ago when I was a child. He never said if he liked them or not. From the second I opened the box and felt these socks, I knew these weren't the crappy socks I'm used to. They are very soft, comfortable and never fall down my leg. And the price is not so bad either. The only reason I posted this review is in response to the guy that said they were scratchy and felt like velcro. There could be nothing further from the truth! I also have sweaty feet and although my feet still sweat in these socks they don't seem to smell bad at the end of the day. Sorry too much information!
NEGATIVE	"As you know this book is the merging of 2 cross country accounts. The mothers journal from the 1950's was FASCINATING. Wish there had been more of it. The authors (daughter and husband) part of it was mediocre at best.Daughter and Husband do lots of complaining about Recreational Vehicles. Lots and lots and lots of complaining about Recreational Vehicles. Still interesting though with the 1950's material.If you have not read it yet read ""Miles from Nowhere"" by barbara savage instead.Peter Soldan"
NEGATIVE	"complete piece of garbage. i read reviews before i purchased and after i did. wish i had seen the negatives first. if it wasnt so ""cheap"" id do what id need for a refund. its a waste of time....ill toss it in the garbage. after about 2 weeks the brew cycle is incomplete. i had to turn it on about 4 times to complete it..by then your coffee is no longer hot! the cup is another piece of ****. the plastic rim that enables the top to fit in place...after you wash it water remains under lid...so when you drink (when there is little left)...you get water pouring down your chin. this thing is junk..maybe ill call black and decker. ill tell 'em what i think of their junk and get my moneyin short..dont buy this piece of **** item....."
NEGATIVE	This book was like trying follow a storyline of a movie that you told somebody to cut out all the connecting pieces. You are left with a bunch of siloquies that have no correlation to the surroundings. Better yet, it was like watching a movie review on TV. You are given the highlight speeches, but never the circumstances in which they are given. Joan did not live in a vaccuum. What she did and what eventually befell her depended on the reaction of those around her. This book is like an archeological dig. You get a lot of disjointed information and a time line, but you are left with a lot of questions about what happened in between these points. If you are interested in what happened to Joan and why it happened, do not waste your money on this low grade cliff notes project.
POSITIVE	I bought this book because it was referenced in another book I read. I found the book to be witty and humorous. It's a fun and short read, thats great for a train or before sleep.The diary entries alternate between Adam and Eve and deal with subjects like intimacy, talking (in Eve's case talking too much), and sexual roles (why does Adam name everything?)Some of the entries were a little dry (hence the 4 stars).
POSITIVE	This Cd has some great hits that will help Puffy on his way with his new self proclaimed name P. Diddy.I feel this CD is worth buying and it will get Puffy his much deserved recognition.
NEGATIVE	This was a required text for a university OS course. The book was very through in the number of topics it covered. However, I found the way the book was written to be very long winded and difficult to understand. I found myself searching on-line most of the time to find supplemental information. Even on basic concepts I had already read about in the book just so I could fully understand most of the topics. I still have the book today and have found it to be a useless reference. There is absolutely nothing clear and to the point anywhere in this book.
NEGATIVE	This was supposed to be a Large/Extra Large size - not even close. More like a one size fits all
NEGATIVE	If you think that by spending a little more money will get you better quality you're wrong. The worst of which being the adjusters, out of the box the adjusting screws were almost frozen in the plastic retainers causing their poor quality to strip out almost immediately. I was using Snap-On screwdrivers so tool quality was of no concern. I spent almost 2 hours just trying to get them to fit decently around the headlight doors and alignment was still an issue. If the headlights weren't so difficult to remove and my factory ones in such poor quality I would have sent them back ASAP. Save your money if you want this style of headlight and go with the cheaper ones found on other sites.
NEGATIVE	I was very mad because this movie would not play on my kindle fire. I went on vacation and was planning to watch it on the plane and it wouldn't play. I also tried to watch it again while I was there(and connected to wifi) it still wouldn't play. What a waste of money.
NEGATIVE	I have bought travel journals before, and this one is alot less than what I expected. No titled pages for hotels, restaurants or expenses...just blank pages with lines to write on. Like I said, just a notebook with a pretty title. Not recommended.
NEGATIVE	I got what I paid for for 4 bucks but they are not good at all. You can see ouut of them and tfhe mirror tent fadded already.
NEGATIVE	"Now I know why I am not a Britney fan. The only song on this album with any kind of originality is ""I'm a slave 4 U"" and I even dislike this song. The rest of the album sounds like one big song that goes on for an hour. The entire sound of this album coupled with the juvenile lyrics makes for bad music. Sorry Britney"
POSITIVE	Both the outstanding and brilliant artwork by international women artists, as well as the inspiring words of women from all walks of life, has made this my favorite gift to women of all ages. To the young, it is the legacy of the best, placing our hope for the future in their hands.One of my daughters gave this gift to me on Mother's Day and the real gift was that now I know that she truly knows her mother's heart. Thank you all. Maria
NEGATIVE	"The description states that this tea has a ""pronounced musty character,"" and they're not kidding! Perhaps my palate is not yet delicate enough to appreciate Pu-erh, or this tea is not representative of others out there, but my experience with this particular sample was that I could have thrown some dirt and/or compost in the teapot and achieved a similar flavor. Not for the faint of heart!"
POSITIVE	One of the angriest records I own. I love this thing. Bitch Called Hope, Wasted Youth Crew, Evil in the Brain and Ya Still a Paper Gangster should be listened to everyday of your life. This is music for when you are having a bad day or just feel like punching the floor. This is old school east coast hardcore.
NEGATIVE	Drivel.........absolutely drivel! If the wax build-up in your ears isn't vibrated loose by the sound emanating from the speakers which are wantinly attempting to commit suicide.....MM is definitely one of the worst if not the worst album I've purchased in the last year. There isn't a sniff of a melody here, nor will your hear one. Somewhere people fell on the bandwagon for a band that produced garbage and felt taken advantage of and then convinced others of their misjudging. Do yourself a HUGE favor, redirect towards the like of Muse or Blueline Medic, your taste bud will be thanking you and as will your ears.
POSITIVE	awesome besides movie skipping it was a dang good movie will rewatch after it the sctraches off it will but more from thises
NEGATIVE	Love the shape and look but quality was 5-and-dime with zero wearability...unless you are looking to dress a scarecrow or a mannequin. Ridiculous to include this as a serious offering for a respectable Derby hat
POSITIVE	Benton Gup gives a very thorough overview of the role of a bank board member and the importance of understanding the major elements that make up a modern financial institution.It is important to note that this is a starter book; if you are currently a bank board member, or contemplating becoming one, you should understand that this book will spur you to further study on major subjects in other books and formats.
POSITIVE	this was a very interesting read . I learned many things reading this book. I have suggested others should read it.
NEGATIVE	I bought this because it was so highly reviewed at Amazon.com but it proved to be a barely passable medieval romance. The lousy heroine out-and-out said that she really HATED kids! The hero always assumed the worst about Golde and immediately proceeded to almost kill her--which really ain't loverlike. What little descriptions of the era could use some improvement by some examples of Roberta Gellis' work.
NEGATIVE	dont buy this for throwing the ''BALLISTIC POLYMER BROKE IN HALF , sog is a chineese piece of crap company
NEGATIVE	The sound is very poor but this is a nice solution for let's say listening to your iPod while you cook... if it's right there next to you. Also, the sound quality is not so good either.However, this are pretty cheap speakers so you are only receiving what you paid for.
POSITIVE	I give this book four stars out of five. The book is about how Rosie and her family are invited to the fair by their Aunt Euterpe. They arrive at the fair and their journey begins. It's a good book that is funny, always exiting, and you might learn something too. If you need a good book to read or if you like A Year Down Yonder or A Long way from Chicago you'll like this book.
NEGATIVE	I'm not sure how they tested it but I don't think they really did. The blades don't even come close enough in size to being able to blend the food. The blades are probably one third of the radius needed. So using the area= pi r squared from high school geometry, it doesn't come close to being able to reach where it's supposed to... lots of chunks of whatever you are trying to blend or turn into a smoothie in the bottom of it's huge container. Easier to mix powder in liquid in an old peanut butter jar. This is pretty much worthless.
POSITIVE	hi... If you're kind like of Metallica, Pearl Jam, and Muse,you should try on this band which came from Malaysia. This band is a four-piece band are the old boys of Malay College Kuala Kangsar(High-Status Boarding School in Malaysia)....Most of their song in this album is not very good compared to the last one album....which is Transcendence.....Sog like Malaynum and Suddenly shown the combination of Rock and Malay culture music which I think is interesting to be on the air.....Friends , please give support for Malay Band
POSITIVE	I got this because it was the cheapest way to get photos and files off my ancient laptop. The enclosure did the job well, but the vinyl case that comes with it had this really strong, raw, persistent cheap tire rubber smell. I should have opened it outside and thrown the case and box away immediately.
POSITIVE	Crofts does solid work, and this--French's first appearance--is one of the best. Crofts attention to detail lends a distinct period feel to setting and character. Crofts' Death of a Train, usually and regrettably out of print, is a classic WWII anti-Nazi mystery piece and another excellent read.
NEGATIVE	How can people simply ignore the dozens of evidences, and facts, for an old Earth? Driven by his hatred of evolution, Morris has created his own science and distorted the bible. Instead of inventing theories, he should read the bible. And I thought Morris and friends hated general revelation, so why is science only right when then talk about it?
NEGATIVE	To call this movie atomspheric is to not understand the word atomspheric! This one falls into the FF (fast foward) award catagory. Don't believe the good reviews, this movie is a boring snooze-fest. Trust me. Unless you like melodramatic Vampire/soap drivel with bad acting. Steer clear of this, especially the Anne Rice/Dark Shadows fans.
NEGATIVE	"I probably have as much experience with 11x17 capable color printers as anyone in the world and I've got to say this is easily the most difficult and unsatisfactory printer I have ever dealt with. HP's last 11x17 product (1220c) had amazing print quality, was faster, and lasted me for 3 solid years of heavy use. By contrast, the 9650 is MUCH slower for ""best"" print setting and MIND BOGGLINLY SLOW for its ""maximum DPI"" setting...try 35minutes for an 11x17 plot. Unacceptable. Not to mention that my printer is now broken and wont print at all."
NEGATIVE	Despite some of the warnings about Amazons packing on this lens, I went for the lowest cost and tried again (better packing with other lenses) with a new EF-S 17-55mm. The carton showed-up today. A large box, deflated airbags and my new $1000 lens in Canon's carton bounced around. I can not believe Amazon hasn't a clue on packing/shipping these lenses. Fortunately, it seems my lens is OK, but this is the last of several purchases I will make direct to Amazon.com.
NEGATIVE	I am a fan of the Black company... However, in comparison, this is garbage. I never related to the hero, the history was dull and confusing... A waste of time.
NEGATIVE	I din't receive that I ask, and never had an answer of the seller. In few words... a lost my money.
POSITIVE	A great cd for fans who love strong deep vocals mix with down tempo drum'n' bass, with a jazz twist. Lenny Laws, Roni Size, and Dj Die are the trio behind this album. If you like Tricky and Portishead, then pick this cd up.
POSITIVE	This is the best sippy cup! I lvoe it because the spout is soft so it is grat for babies who are transitioning and are not used to stiff hard spouts. Also it has a cap so it is great to carry it everywhere. I bought two as the first one my dog chew it and I almost cried for the loss but I was happy when I got the second one. I would have preferred to get a pink color but I knew it would be random so I didn't mind.
POSITIVE	"On this tribute to Count Basie, Keely is accompanied by an 18-piece band and a 22-member string orchestra led by pianist/conductor Dennis Michaels. Keely definitely swings Basie-style, using his musical style to interpret timeless standards as ""How High The Moon,"" and ""Mood Indigo."" The cd also includes swing versions of ""How Sweet It Is"" and ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You,"" which captures and re-introduces the beautiful essence of the big-band Swing music era. Keely Smith began her career as the female singer in Louis Prima's band which recently inspired ""The Gap"" to use ""Jump, Jive, and Wail"" in one of their ad campaigns. I'm glad to see that Swing is back in swing, and this album is definitely a must-have."
POSITIVE	This is a permanent addition to my tool box. I use it for everthing (obviously not when I'm framing). You can get a ceramic blade, carbide wood blade, and the regular thin kerf steel blade. It gets used quite a bit in the post-framing stages of a project. Handy and cuts though most materials. The other cordless saws are too big and I just use my circular (corded) for those jobs, this is small enough to go with me in my tool box. I love it becuase I'm on the job everyday, however I'm not sure how helpful it would be to the occasional user unless it was always charged which is not practical most times.
POSITIVE	All I have to say is that this was a great show that should have never been cancelled. Even though we, the fans, couldn't get it back we sort of compromised and asked for DVD Box sets. It took us about two years but our hard work paid off. This sounds like a great box set and it will greatly appreciated it my collection. The only thing I ask is that the unaired pilot be included in the third season, so everyone can have every episode. I have already preordered this set and I am sure to be happy with my purchase.
NEGATIVE	I bought 100 of these on sale, I thought Sony, should be good. How wrong I was.I've had a high fail rate, about 3 of every 5 disks. I've had no problem with the red hp or verbatim disks. If I try something other than those 2 again then I'll buy the smallest quanity I can, see if they work first before buying 100. Not even good coasters :-(
NEGATIVE	"We purchased this walker a few months before my daughter was born thinking that it was a good price so why pass it up. Well, when it finally came time to open up the box, the music didn't work. In the instructions it says that there is no way to replace the batteries ... well, if you happen to be married to a very determined ""handy man"", it can be done. It's some type of watch battery that costs about $15. When the music does play it is extremely loud so we don't even use it after going through all of that trouble. We don't want to hurt our little one's ears. She does like banging on the steering wheel and playing with the little gadgets on the sides though. She isn't quite big enough to make it go all by herself so she just sits and plays in it while I'm cooking in the kitchen with a little stool underneath her feet. I also purchased a stand alone jumper and feel that it was a little more appropriate and money better spent. Just my opinion though. :)"
NEGATIVE	I'm surprised this toy gets as many positive comments as it does. The fact that the selected song stops playing as soon as the ball is moved is very frustrating for my baby and me.Maybe we'll both like it better when she's older (she's 16 months and got it when she was about 10 months).
POSITIVE	"I am a My Little Pony collector, in college. I admit, I am a little predjudiced, but I love this castle. My parents bought it for me for Christmas, and although it took forever to get all the little stickers on, I haven't has a problem getting this toy to stay together. It spends the majority of its time on a shelf, but it does get some play from my friends' kids. The balconies and such seem to be made to ""break away"" and fall apart rather than actually snap off, but the kids seem to learn real quick how to put it back together. Based on other reviews though, I suspect that Hasbro released this toy a little too early, without a decent amount on consumer testing. I also have the Cotton Candy Cafe and the Celebration Salon, and those stay together wonderfully."
NEGATIVE	This book presents, in a fun and easy to read format, how your body functions and processes food. I found that portion of the book to be very interesting and informative; however, to follow the suggested diet which is very constricting, and would mean, in most cases, that one empty their entire kitchen, and refrigerator of all food, spices, drinks, etc. currently residing there, and replenish with the very specific, earthy items listed in the book is crazy.While I understand a change in eating habits is needed to become healthier, I found this diet to be extreme, and would eventually set folks up to fail because it is so way out there.I will keep the book as a reference to the processing of food through the body and will definitely not even attempt to follow the recommended diet.
NEGATIVE	"Just about all of the editions in the ""Greatest Heroes and Legends of the Bible"" are excellent - good story telling and they at least attempt to stick to the Biblical script and scriptures - NOT ""The Garden of Eden"" - YHVH as the sun in the sky and the ""all seeing eye"" - and then a very silly, bizarre, and uncalled for section with Eve and the Serpent - not to mention the just plain disregard for the Bible. This is supposed to be ""safe"" for kids to watch. We just threw this one away - time to watch Joshua or Moses or Daniel or Sampson...but not this poorly executed edition.What were you guys thinking?"
POSITIVE	"This recording is human and good in a removed or distant manner. In this way it has a ""Man Who Fell to Earth"" vibe of observational detachment. I will take another chance and also describe it as ""numb psychedelia."" It made me want to stop using conjunctions in speech, like a robot."
POSITIVE	It's not much different from the movie. Aside it is great comic relief for one who likes light-heart humor. It just a great TV series..
POSITIVE	...and that is a good thing when you don't want to eat the whole batch of cookies yourself. There are also recipies for mini loaves of bread and batches of biscuits.I have made cookies, pies, bread pudding, muffins and crisps from this book and they have all turned out great. There is a great variety of recipies, and it is helpful for adapting your own favorites by using the ratios as a guide. I liked it so much that I got it for my Mom for Christmas!
POSITIVE	This product has considerably increased my milk production! Its taste is strong, but it works. I will now try the version without alcohol. I hope it keeps working.
POSITIVE	The Old Dogs cd, released in 1998, has 11 songs on it, all the ones you listed and then some... Now maybe it was a 2 volume deal on vinyl & yer product is mis-labled, but the cd sure don't rate a $50 sale tag. It's priceless enough, but the dang thing's readily available at yer local. I'm on my 3rd copy now, cos folk keep stealin' 'em off'n me & I paid $4.99 fer this'n. Don't get me wrong, It's a great listen, over & over, it jus' ain't rare enough to warrant yer sale price based on yer description. Now, as I said, if there's somethin' special about yourn that make it worth more, well that's fine, but ye oughter describe what that be...
NEGATIVE	I saw this toy on a show and it didn't have the sounds from it. This thing is funny but so loud. You can't leave it plugged in for more than a second because of the sound.
POSITIVE	Far more than a how-to, this book also paints a portrait of an extraordinary woman. Jackie lived the most public of lives, and she did so with grace. She never lost sight of what was really important: friendship, loyalty, intellectual curiosity, generosity. If she was also a product of her times--if she believed that a man was a necessary accessory--she chose those men carefully, for maximum impact. The authors distill Jackie's methods while keeping sight of their ethical underpinnings. A breezy, engaging read.
POSITIVE	This is a great camera. I previously used the D-460 and was ready to upgrade to something with more resolution. The C-700 has been a joy to learn. The 10x zoom with Olympus' wonderful optical quality lens take great pictures. Be sure to try the auto braketing feature - it's fun and provides additional clarity in low-light conditions. The camera is compact and light and fits nicely in the Tamrac Digital 6 camera bag. I purchased the lens adapter and filter kit with the intention of protecting my lens and have been very happy with this setup.
POSITIVE	"I'm a Jet Li fan & this movie allows him to not only perform martial art, but to portray a beast & a human. One could possibly say that he shows the two sides of humanity. In any account, the 5 stars less one, is due to some ""over-the-top"" violence in a few segments of the film.His martial art performance, like always, is phenomenal. And unlike a lot of his other movies, you actual see him be an actor. It's a great combination.Recommend for adults only."
POSITIVE	"This a good CD. But I wanted to make this review to answer J. Tarken ""thirty-three"" who made a review that stands in the spotlight-reviews. The song that plays when Neo is working on his computer, the first time we see him is Dissolved Girl by Massive Attack. I was very dissappointed that this song wasn't on the soundtrack. If you liked Dissolved Girl I recommend you to check out Mezzanine by Massive Attack. Dissolved Girl is by far not the best song on the album. Buy this one and Mezzanine!"
NEGATIVE	Well for the price, you definately get what you pay for. They don't work at all. Please don't waste your time and money with these. You're much better off spending $50 on the true Canon brand battery.
POSITIVE	Great mic for a reasonable price. Sleek design and complete with hard shell case and mic mount. Mic is so sensitive.
POSITIVE	What a powerful book! It's so full of inspiration and truth that it would be impossible NOT to get something spiritual out of it. I would strongly suggest every person who has ever searched for something deeper in their life to read this book and let it move you. Its a breath of freash air to a struggling soul.
POSITIVE	"Godsey's book, as other reviewers have noted, is not just for Baptists and will probably appeal much more to Episcopalians, Presbyterians (like me), Methodists, Unitarians, Quakers and even agnostics than to his Baptist brethren, who have already come close to burning him for heresy.It is a book that simply states in understandable language what it means to be ""Christian"" in a new millennium.It is a slender volume and quite readable, but if you are busy, I can sum it up for you. Godsey says: ""Love God. Love your neighbor.""Sound familiar?"
POSITIVE	I absolutely loved their debut album, and could not stop listening to it. Affirmation is just as good, and now I cant quit listening to this one. I wonder how they can continue making albums where all songs are just great. Amazing.
NEGATIVE	This item is a mini gender changer ONLY. it is not cross wired to act as a null modem and does not function for that purpose. The distributor admits this fact, offered to refund my 13 cent purchase but has not removed the item for sale or modified the description, which makes me believe that this was advertised incorrectly on purpose to generate sales.Incidentally, the shipping on a 13 cent item is $2.98.
POSITIVE	The Bone Collector is an actual pleasing supensef- ul film. It has a good cast. And the effects were awsome. Get this title for aa good scare. I was dissapointed it didn't have enough blood in it though.
POSITIVE	"I stayed up until 1:00 AM to finish it... it was so good, I couldn't wait to see what happened next! At first I thought it would be your typical ""chick"" type book... but it was not at all!!! At the risk of sounding cliche', I must say this book tells a wonderful and inspiring story of love, personal growth, and following your dreams. The NYC references were so fun to read, having lived in NYC myself. The story itself holds a great, positive message, and an interesting twist at the end. I REALLY HOPE to see this come out in a movie! I highly recommend this book!!!"
POSITIVE	Joe Pernice is definitely one of the best songwriters alive today. Yours, Mine & Ours is another great album in his catalog (could even be the best, although I will see how it stands the test of time). From the first listen, you know you must own this album. The opening track, Weakest Shade of Blue, is reminiscent of many songs Joe has penned before, except he is now allowing little rays of happiness creep into his music...and the fun does not end there. As with most of Joe's albums, there is not a bad song anywhere to be found and it leaves struggling amature musicians, like myself, wondering how it comes so effortlessly for Joe. For fans, you already have this..but for newbies to the Pernice world, or anyone else interested in good, pure songrwriting...pick this one up. Ultimately this is a really fun Sunday drive with the windows down album.
POSITIVE	So, this was the title release when the PS3 hit the market. Looks great. Gave a new perspective to military shooters...you're fighting aliens. I'm not much for multi-player, so I can't comment on that.I do have a beef about no trophies. What was Sony thinking? I feel trophies give another level of challenge to games...plus some bragging rights. :-) Good thing they added them to Resistance 2. If you care about the trophies, skip this one and get Resistance 2. I'd expect Resistance 3 to step it up even more.
NEGATIVE	The reasons why this gets a two.1: There is not one normal person in this movie. Everyone carries a gun, knife, everyone deals drugs, everyone is a perv. Each character that comes in the movie is messed up. Completely stupid.2: the word f**k is used so much, I was almost laughing at one scene that was suppose to be serious. imdb.com records 328 it is said, the movie itself is only 122 minutes. Do the math and figure how many times you'll hear it a minute. Thats abusing it,taking away the effect of the word.but its also pretty sick and gory, which is cool. so expect a haedcore action movie that is completely unbelieveable.
NEGATIVE	Took three weeks to finally receive this thing. When it arrived it took about three tries to finally get started. Then once you tried to play a game, the joystick only moved in the down direction. If you try to order one of these controllers, you better be careful where you get it from. Needless to say I will be returning mine.
POSITIVE	This was my first kd lang CD, which I bought when it first came out. This is my second replacement, as the previous two were worn out from so much use. This cd shows off kd's voice. It has humor, and is deeply moving with a message (Nowhere To Stand), and has great songs about how people feel going in and out of love (Full Moon Full of Love and Pulling Back The Reigns). After a few plays, you have to sing along to it. If you want to really experience her voice, you should see her live. But this album is the next best thing.
NEGATIVE	I think I must have listened to a different album than these other reviews because I found nothing redeeming at all in this album.This was recommended to me by a friend (who incidently has poor taste in music), and after listening to the album, I can firmly conclude that this album is a waste of your time. Every single song is an exact copy of some other more famous musicians work. I have yet to hear an original song, and believe me, I've looked! Don't waste your money or your time with these guys.
NEGATIVE	I'm sorry to say that it was really a struggle for me to finish this book. From the very beginning it was not able to keep my interest. There seemed to be way too much going on that made the story line a bit difficult to follow, but really a whole lot of nothing happening throughout the story other than people being killed off. Also, it was just a bit too unbelievable for me.I received a complimentary copy of this book in order to review it.
POSITIVE	I purchased this for work. it's easy to tear off strips but a really good tape. Great for taping wires or cables to a wall or floor.
POSITIVE	Wow, I loved this book. This was my first read from this author and am very pleased. Look forward to the others.
NEGATIVE	The bottle of perfume you sent is square and sits on a table. You advertised the tall rectangle size that can go in your purse - which is what I thought I was buying.Why did you do that?
NEGATIVE	fruity,fruity,fruity.i just have to show a list pros ;choose from stars like jeff hardy ,stonecold,and the rock.ok graphics. cons;you basically have to kill yourself to get out of the hell in a cell.the specials are jacked up.you cant even here the commentaries.thousands more. i played it with my cousin.if you like wwe,get here comes the pain,raw2,or legends of wrestling 2 because it is better and has a better season mode with storylines.
POSITIVE	"I needed some pill bottles for my clumsy, arthritic and weak hands. Having first tried and been disappointed in ""Easy Open Vials 5 Pack"", I decided to order these on the advice of a friend. They work very well for me--both bottle and screw-off lid are just large enough to grasp easily, and the screw-off lids can be put on gently by me, so they are easy to get off with just a couple turns. The bottle with the blue lid, and the one with the white lid, are my favorites.Customer service at the Nalgene company was also very user-friendly in actually measuring the bottles for me so I could get a more accurate idea of their size. Well pleased, I would order again."
NEGATIVE	I bought this because it is the only version of the Piano Quintet on DVD Audio. The video was a bonus, but I agree with the first reviewer that it is annoying; I turned it off right away: No one watches music that way.The recorded sound is fine enough, but the performance, especially the piano, is deathly dull, bloodless. I only listened all the way through because I spent the money to buy it in the first place. You are much better off with the Rubinstein-Guaneri for much less money.
POSITIVE	I have this dvd with all the Don Knotts films, but haven't had time to watch all the movies. I must say though, that The Ghost and Mr. Chicken is one of my all time favorite movies. Don is hysterical as the bumbling reporter wanna-be Luther who tries to get his big break by spending the night in a local haunted house. If you think old movies aren't worth your time, think again. This one is adorable, and is suitable for younger children who don't scare easily as well.
NEGATIVE	Ludacris has dropped release therapy, which IMHO is just that release. therapy. This album is not his best, or even second. I was rather dissapointed and confused listening to the album. The beats and rhymes seem off. Being a native Atlantan, from the SWATS (grew up with the Outkast, Goodie MOB, Ludacris, etc) I felt like the air let out a ballon this one. I hate to give bad reviews, but I...oh forget it. This album could and should have been much better. I would firmly suggest to just download the hottest track, Money Maker. The rest..well try BEFORE you buy!
POSITIVE	It's not messy and seems to kill the fleas. I use it on furniture and on the carpet and it works well. The inverted feature is the best.
POSITIVE	found a copy of this book at a thrift store, and showed it to a friend who loved it so much i bought her another from amazon. it didnt hurt that she has 2 great danes and there was one on the cover. [and another inside.] the photos are beautiful . i love the little dachshund she found on the beach and the photo is adorable.
NEGATIVE	Snakes and Ladders bored me to tears. I only finished it because it was assigned reading in a class. Sometimes I felt disconnected from the author for several pages until Mehta got back to the point.
POSITIVE	Beats Kaytee Fiesta, if youve been getting that. More nuts, more interesting tidbits for your feathered friend.
POSITIVE	I purchased this nativity/advent calendar for my 5 year old son. I was looking for something that was high enough quality to last through his childhood and with any luck, through HIS kids childhood. This unit is built out of pressboard, and is good quality. With care it should last generations. The magnetic background allows your children to create manger scenes with ease and it is fun for the whole family. The only drawback to this unit is the lack of any type of base or stand. Due to this fact, I recommend that you mount it on the wall if possible, so that your kids don't pull it over when trying to open the little doors (which are kept closed by magnets). Over all I am very pleased with this Advent Calendar, and I do recommend it!
POSITIVE	Great book! Lots of information about GL. I enjoyed reading what happened in the episodes before I was an avid watcher.
POSITIVE	Thought it was the wrong item at first but it stretched as much as it needed to and makes a nice difference in the grip.
NEGATIVE	I have read hundreds of mystery/thriller books and rarely have given up on a book half-way through - which I did with this one. I could not stand the self-centered, argumentative main character, Bess Grady. Neither she or the plot were believable - even for a work of fiction.
NEGATIVE	i should be punished for buying and reading this poor excuse of a book. no story line , expected more fairytale and less porn. my bad. stick to vampires anne.
NEGATIVE	Bearpaw fits horribly - tight through the toes and loose about the heel. I tried two different pairs (one order) with the same experience. And to make matters worse, Clausette charges an 8% restocking fee in addition to paying to return the merch, which was exorbitant in the first place.
NEGATIVE	"I was disappointed by the pictures in this book: they are nice but lack the originality and quality of an artful photographer. Since I am not a photography expert, I can`t elaborate about the mistakes or shortcomings of the photographer. As unknowledgeable about technique as I might be though, I know beauty when I see it. These pictures would be at home in a geography book or a travel guide: good but plain. Instead, I recommend ""The Bridge of Turquoise"" by Roloff Beny, a Canadian photographer. This book is full of magnificent pictures that please the eye and touch the soul like only the work of an artist can do."
NEGATIVE	Recommended my sister get this for our three young children as a Christmas present. She recorded herself on CD reading the story, putting a photo of her inside the cover, so all in all a nice gift, but the story itself is so incredibly bland and boring. I love simple stories that leave much to the imagination but this one is just dull, drab writing.
NEGATIVE	I felt like I was back in sixth grade watching a film the teacher would put on when she needed time to grade papers!The picture was weak, grainy, and the sound lacking for a DVD. The information was OK. If you want to enjoy the sounds and sights of Yellowstone in your home, spend your time and money elsewhere.
NEGATIVE	The rotating barrel doesn't lock in place - or slips and starts spinning without pressing the unlock button. Not very warm,takes quite a long time to get a strong curl on even dry hair. Fine for super-fast touch ups, but that's about it. Happy it was only $20, but I wish I hadn't bought it!
NEGATIVE	My Title says it all. My Wife and I sat down to watch a Christmas movie together and decided to rent this.I wish I could get my 1hr and 29 mins back. This movie is bad, only reason I gave it 2 stars was Reese Witherspoon.Vaughn still can't act his way out of a paper bag and the rest of the cast was painful to watch. If you want a funnyChristmas movie to rent on Amazon check out Surviving Christmas with Ben Affleck.
NEGATIVE	I have owned this camera for approximately 16 months.Sometimes great photos, but mostly blurry and unreliable.One day, camera stopped working - no clue what went wrong (not mistreated).I have owned three Canon ELPHs over five+ years - never a problem.Loser camera, switched back to my Olympus C5060 wide zoom - beautiful image quality - and it still works!I may try the G7, but not sure if I should buy another Canon (except for ELPH line).
POSITIVE	I was able to get it at a better cost than at the retailer. The product arrived on time and in good condition.
NEGATIVE	I got this 4 my daughter 4 X-mas. It's the only movie she ask for, but when she tried to watch it, it wouldn't work. There is a message that comes up saying wrong universal code. What does this mean, never seen this before. So basically I wasted my money & now need to purchase a new one.
NEGATIVE	I only gave this book 1 star because there was no option of giving it zero stars. I wish there was, becuase this is an awful book. Save your money.
NEGATIVE	"Would not recommend this to anyone, boring, the ""instructor"" is difficult to listen to and somewhat annoying. I would return this product... but seriously it is not worth my time."
POSITIVE	Bought this pillow at 15 weeks pregnant with my first. Its a little slice a heaven. Its a bit spendy for a pillow, but the comfort it has provided for me in the last couple of weeks is totally worth it. I also like that it doesnt take as much of the bed as other body pillows (my husband is grateful for that!) I also like that this can be split apart and used as a boppy later on.The only thing I would change is to have some sort of a washable cover for when it is in 1 piece. Thus why I rate 4 instead of 5 stars. It does comes with cheap feeling covers for the ends when it is broken apart, but that doesnt do anything for me until I take it apart. Overall, very happy with the purchase and highly recommend it.
NEGATIVE	All thats missing from this abortion is Paul Bunyon and Babe the Blue Ox.Stop me when I get to the BS: Old Alley Oop is the baddest thing God ever made, he has senses God would envy, and the kick of a mule. So one day he's ridin along with 80 gallons of whisky tied to his horse, and gets captured by the Injuns. They strip him naked, steal all his clothes, and tie him up. Its Winter, too.So he chews thru his leather straps, kick-boxes his guard into unconsciousness, amputates the man's leg, and escapes into the snow. Its 200 miles to his cabin, Winter, and he's in his birthday suit. But he makes it, gnawing on the leg, and using it to bludgeon bears (who oughta be hibernating) along the way. Much later the Crow Killer gets some payback on his captors, wearing all the fur coats and union-suits, and hoodie-footies the Indians took from him. Huh?Only perfessers would get pulled in by this crap.
POSITIVE	"I don't have this anthology yet, but I'm going to buy it as soon as I break for lunch and can get out to the bookstore. The inclusion of ""Call Me Joe"" by Poul Anderson is enough reason to pick it up. I consider it a classic. Written in 1957, it's as relevant and as farseeing as any story written today."
POSITIVE	I saw these dudes in downtown Fresno,Ca. in a *** club but these guys rocked the place, Awesome drummer!!!But whats up with kareem abdul karate kicking bass player? total freaks from another planet.I recommend listening to these guys on acid.I don't stray to far from Hank williams Sr. but these guys are an exception.I got this Cd playing in my John Deer. Budderball and cross tops keep me working 12 hour days.
NEGATIVE	If you were nailing or gluing the base to something, then they would be fine. I had to glue large washers to the base to keep them from toppling over all the time. They need a wider base to be stable, especially on carpet.
POSITIVE	I LOVE my kindle!! I can read it anywhere and download books anywhere. I had an ebook yrs ago and never used it much because I couldn't remember how to down load books and the books were too expensive. I have read some kindle books that cost me nothing and most are approximately $10. I archive the books I have read.The only downside I can see is that it doesn't have a light of its own, so I can't read it in the dark.
NEGATIVE	"We absolutely love this movie and our kids really enjoyed the parts they were able to view. Unfortunately, the disc skipped several times and stopped completely after a while, so we returned it for a replacement. We received a replacement but had the same problem with that disc as well. All of our other DVDs work fine, so we're confident the problem lay with the actual disc and not our DVD player. We were informed that there was a ""widespread problem"" with this title and no more replacements would be available. What I don't understand, then, is why this disc is still for sale on Amazon assuming their whole batch is bad. At any rate, I wouldn't recommend purchasing it until the problems have been rectified."
POSITIVE	And it has been hard for the white rapper to come back from bottom to the top I give Marshall 5 stars because he had to do a lot of things to make it to the top and thats why I give the young man 5stars. Buy this cd.
NEGATIVE	"We live in a ""low to med."" coverage area and this phone provides service in areas most other phones do not."
POSITIVE	I love this dvd!! I just got it in today and i already worked out to another one but i decided to put this one in just to see what it was about. As soon as i put it on i was already working out for the 2nd time this morning and i didn't stop til the end! Its a great video and it really makes you sweat! I would certainly tell others(already started lol) about turbo jam! Certainly worth the money i paid for it!
POSITIVE	I thought this book was great! Great characters, exciting dialogue, and a plot that had me begging for more!
POSITIVE	I might as well add another positive comment. This is thus far the best penetrating oil I've ever come across, which is no surprise, every Kano product I have used is simply unsurpassed in performance. Every mechanic shop on this planet should have a can of Kroil handy at all times. Not only trash other penetrating oils, toss the breaker bars too. This stuff is just to good...
NEGATIVE	"I bought rod's new cd today and couldn't wait to hear him put ""his style"" on some old standards. Well, I wish I had waited to review the cd on amazon before I purchased it. I find the whole thing a let down. One of the best things about Stewart has always been ""his style"", you always knew it was him from the first note. This cd has nothing to do with Stewart, except his voice projecting some lyrics. Too bad, the classics done ""his way"" sounded like a good idea."
POSITIVE	"Is there anything more to say about Social D? Being a little ""older"" & growing up in SoCal - this band was a fundamental part of my teenage angst years. Of course there were so many essential ""old-school"" punk bands - but for some reason you just always knew Social D would be around for the long haul. This band is phenomenal all the way around. Not many bands can sound BETTER live than they do on their recordings. Social D is one of the few and undeniably one of the best. This album shows they have no sign of slowing down - and thank you for that!!! Well, I know there are a lot more talented writers/reviewers out there - I just had to put in my twenty-seven cents and praise one of the greatest most influential bands of all time. Here's to you - and thanks!"
NEGATIVE	This video was not what I expected. I was expecting Brendan to give at least a basic explanation of his training as well as tips on training and technique. What I got was video of Brendan swimming with some other guy narrating. The narration was a vague explanation of what makes Brendan Henson a good breaststroke swimmer. I honestly feel I could have just watched Youtube videos of Brendan swimming and got just as much out of it.If you are a Brendan Hansen fan and just want to see him swim and talk in a few small interviews (they give no insight into how to become a better breaststroke swimmer), then buy this video.
POSITIVE	For their size and incredibly discounted price, these are not bad speakers. I tote them with me to use when working on location. They're a bit heavy for constant schlepping, but at least have a modicum of bass response. Unlike some other small speakers, at least you know there IS bass on the recording. A very good deal and acceptable/decent sound.
POSITIVE	Excellent so far - I have only begun reading it, but it is very good and I know will continue to be based upon the author and his experience. Highly recommended to any serious strength/bodybuilding athlete.
POSITIVE	I have been eating gluten free for 5 years and this is the best bread I have found. It turns out great every time. I use a Kitchenaid mixer and a glass baking pan to make a large loaf. I slice it and freeze half. It tastes best toasted.
POSITIVE	"Although this book is a few years old it was an inspiration and had lots of good info in it. I found my wedding dress in it and made it from the picture. We also got the idea of a ""white bar,"" which no one in New Orleans had ever heard of nor would offer us. Very stylish, very chic, and while I also recommend Bridal Bargains and the Diane Warner books, this book you read after those two."
NEGATIVE	"I saw the special on TV which made me curious enough to buy the CD. I can admire Brooks for his attempt at something musically different. But, I will not be listening to this one again. He sounds like Prince trying to do Country. Yuck. I was expecting something a little more sincere, rock, or raw. The music just doen't have any ""sparks""."
POSITIVE	This book was required reading for my up and coming 6th grader. She hates to read, but this book has been a riot. She is not into Barbie, pink or much girly stuff. Fortunately, neither is Catherine. She and my daughter have a lot in common. I would highly recommend this book for all girls. If the boys can get past the sprinkling of puberty stuff they will like her antics too.
NEGATIVE	Being a life long doors fan I was greatly looking forward to reading this book. It was a total disappointment. The text is self indulgent and overly emotional to the point where it bores the reader. How the characters parallel those of the Doors is enough to enrage a true Doors fan and the events are totally unbelieveable. Ray Manzarek is a very talented musician and should stick with what he knows.
POSITIVE	This tiny product does the job.I use with the Jabra BT620s headphones and it works just perfect.I am an average user of ipod and i find the sound quality to be just fine.I just leave the ipod on my back pack or wherever it is (you shouldn't care as long it is with you somewhere) and then control everything from my Jabra BT620s.I would recommend you got both bluetooth devices from Jabra as I did, that way you make sure that you wont need different chargers. This one comes with a mini USB charger that can be used for the headphones too, but the headphones also include a wall charger which is usually faster.So in my opinion this is a pretty good combo if you are trying to go wireless with your ipod. Plus the headphones will still be good for all kind of different things.
NEGATIVE	I don't claim to be a master knife fighter, but I have found most of the information in this book elsewhere on the Internet and available for free. There were some parts that I found new and interesting. For example the chapters on rolling and closed knife techniques.But, everything thing in this book is still just an overview. The chapters are very short and don't go into much depth. They just give you a few pictures to work with. I was hoping to see detailed step by step manuevers for foot work and perhaps a detailed map of the body labelling pressure points.The book was not what I expected. Try google before you commit to buying a book.
POSITIVE	"This is an excellent well-made documentary. I was not expecting that at all. It left me with an empty shallow feeling, but sometimes that's just how life is. If you consider yourself a KISS fan, you need to watch this documentary. It will make you see KISS from the perspective of true KISS fans. There is no happy ""hollywood"" ending here, you might even start to dislike KISS after watching this, but you'll definitely feel something for the fans."
POSITIVE	These authors take you through the 5-book Trilogy (although they mostly focus on the first 3 books) in a series of essays. They are all light hearted, but some of them are more serious that others. It also includes a great interview of Douglas Adams from the 80s.I had a lot of fun with the book and remembering my favorite scenes. The essays also helped me see different interpretations of the actions of the characters. I recommend it for the bookshelf of any H2G2 fan!
NEGATIVE	Mounting the rack on the vehicle is not an easy process. The rack is not designed for cars with plastic bumpers. The thumb screws that tighten the legs & arms are made of cheap black plastic and can easily be stripped. The Saris Bones 805-2-Bike Trunk Mount Rack is poorly designed.May I suggest you go out and purchase a Thule bike carier, or hitch mount carrier by Thule. You get what you pay for...
POSITIVE	Non-fiction literature, specially historic literature, can at times be dreadfully boring and full of confusing details. This book redeems every boring historic volume I have read to date. The author hooks you in right away, and provides vivid details of Marie Antoinette's life in her early years in Austria, her teenage and adult years in Versailles, and her last years as a prisoner of the revolution. From the fabric materials and colours Marie Antoinette prefered, to various accounts reflecting her taste in elegant simplicity, entertainment, beauty and amusement, this book gives the reader a glimpse of what Marie Antoinette was like as a person, a wife, a mother, a friend, and a ruler.
POSITIVE	The portable CD Players has excellent sound and very good for the price. The only draw back is the addition of batteries that must be inserted to have it work with the power cord.
NEGATIVE	I purchased a set of these from Amazon based on all of the sterling reviews and after using and subsequently returning them I can only surmise that Apple's earbuds (which most reviewers replaced with these) must be horrendous. I was utterly shocked at the tinny Am transistor radio sound that these produced. The earbuds that came with my Sandisk Sansa player were infinitely better, though they broke very quickly. After returning these I tried many others and was very pleased with the sound, price and comfort of the Phillips surround sound earphones (14.OO) at Walmart. I then tried the Maximo earphones after reading the reviews on Amazon. The sound of these is phenomenal for the same price as the Sony'. I ended up keeping both pairs because the Phillips were so comfortable and the Maximo produced such wonderful sound, though the Phillips sound is quite respectable and I would have been happy with them if I had not tried the Maximos
NEGATIVE	Just had an unsettling experience with another Pyrex dish (and it was from the original company). A bowl that I had been using for the cats water dish suddenly exploded for no reason sending shards of glass everywhere. Bowl was probably about 20 years old, but not put in the dishwasher or subject to any sudden temperature changes, and when I checked on the internet there were numerous complaints about exploding Pyrex dishes! So only place for this is the TRASH!!!
POSITIVE	I love this cd! It includes I'll Never Break Your Heart it's beautiful and I thinks everybody knows it; Nunca Te Haré Llorar(Spanish Version of I'll Never Break Your Break)I speak spanish and it really touches my heart and last but definetly not least Quit Playin' Games With My Heart Live Version. I think everyone will love it!
POSITIVE	I bought this DVD based on other reviews that I had read. I am not a total yoga nut, but am partial to the overall benefits from the practice. I really enjoyed this DVD and look forward to doing it again TOMORROW! Though I am not into commiting the mantras and chants to memory, I did not find them distracting. This DVD is very low impact, however you get a great BURN and your heart rate gets going. It is fun and made me feel very free. I have small children and this was perfect for nap time, no jumping, stomping and the like. I would reccommend it to anyone that likes to look good and feel good, yet does not want to slave at the gym or get bored to death from watching the same home workout DVD for the 50th time. The only thing I did not like was that it seemed at the end to just drag on, but if you are into the mantras and closing prayer, then you may not expecience this.
NEGATIVE	I'd have to say that I disagree with these other reviews. I thought this album was a poor attempt at grindcore. It tried to be, but fell short, even the melodic parts were horrible. These people have no idea how to write music.
POSITIVE	I thought this book was great to teach children about loss and the love of a mother to her child and I would recommend it to teachers. It seemed to conjure up deep emotions from many of its readers and listeners due to the sensitive subject of death. The content is good for third grade and up, however, second grade might be able to grasp the concept of loss. I Love You Forever is definitely NOT for kinder and first. I would compare this book to My Friend Rusty. This book is also about the loss of life except it deals with losing a friend rather than a mother. Make sure you have a box of tissue when you read this one!!!
POSITIVE	I started reading the books so i would know what my teenage daughter was reading and to be able to talk to her about things she was interested in. I didn't believe i would be receiving much enjoyment out of the series. This was definitely NOT the case as i loved the books so much i couldn't put them down and read them in 5 days. I highly recommend them.
POSITIVE	This was great fun but don't count on using it more than once. The paper is rather thin and the scotch tape rips it.
POSITIVE	I absolutly love this show!! There not another show like it. It's something you can sit down and watch with your family. It shows how strangers can turn out to be the best family. One of the best westerns out there. The character's and story lines are fabulous. Can't wait for season two!!!!
POSITIVE	"I have owned numerous releases of the vinyl and CDs of this album over the years, and I would have to say this is the best sounding one of them all. The packaging is top notch as well, with the CDs encased in a great box that replicates the front and back covers of the original album.The music itself is great, of course. As it would turn out, this would be the only real album legendary guitarist Jeff Beck would record with the Yardbirds. Shortly after this released, the Yardbirds lost Paul Samwell Smith, gained Jimmy Page, and then lost Jeff Beck. For a short time, Beck and Page led a two pronged guitar attack, which two of the best songs on this collection, ""Happenings Ten Years Time Ago"" and ""Psycho Daisies,"" capture. It always leaves me to wonder what could have been if only the Beck/Page era had lasted longer."
POSITIVE	The Phantom Tollbooth is a wonderfully ridiculous tale. Milo, a kid with nothing to do, discovers a strange cardboared tollbooth leading to a magnificient world. In this strange world, he encounters many queer allies. Milo can easily be related to because before he discovers the tollbooth, he is bored and has nothing to do. My favorite part of the book is the end, which I won't give away. All in all, I really liked this book. I recommend this book to advanced readers and people who don't easily get confused. Have fun reading The Phantom Tollbooth.
NEGATIVE	I choose this because I love great period pieces especially British but.this particular movie hazards of The heart was ok but I didn't enjoy The Lady Hamilton movie especially seeing Vivien Leigh in That Hamilton Woman for me nothing else compares to it.
POSITIVE	1. Juneau (3.36)2. The Art of American Football (BBC Wales session) (2.29)3. This Years Most Open Heartbreak (Radio One Rock Show) (2.38)4. Juneau (music video for computers)
NEGATIVE	The first time I plugged in the battery charger in China I heard a pop and the charge light went out. It seemed to work so I continued trying to use it, but after a few days it had completely failed. I have returned it, but ended up having to pay for the return postage. This is a thumbs-down.
NEGATIVE	I was a bit dissapointed usually Johanna Lindsey books are very good but I found that it left much to be desired. It started off with a good interesthing idea that I've found to be quite unique, a younge woman autioning herself off to save her family, and luckly getting bought by a nice, handsome, rich, tittled younge man. But after that it sort of gets BORING. Everything you knew was just going to be alright when the main character gets kidnapped, this book didn't make me laugh or at least smile, nor did it make me cry, or hurrah it. I suggest that if your looking for a good read to not read this book.
NEGATIVE	According to Osborn, God does not want anyone to be sick. All one has to do is to ask God for healing, and God will heal the sick person. He does not believe what he writes. If he did, he would not have included an out when what he presents does not work. His out is that if the person is not healed, the sick person and the prayer do not have enough faith. Like all who use this out for unanswered prayer, he does not define how much faith is enough faith. Presumably, if the prayer and sick are atheists, who deny God's existence, and the prayer offers up a philippic, sarcastic prayer, and the sick person is healed, then they had enough faith. However, if the prayer and sick are devout Christians whose virtue and piety are beyond question and who have never doubted God and the sick is not healed, then they did not have enough faith.
POSITIVE	it has one BIG advantage over the other brands. At least from my tests in-store, it appears to be one of the only ones to play mp3 DVDs (not just CDs). That's a big deal because you can cram 4.7 gigs of mp3 data and play it on here! With THAT feature you wouldn't need the 5-disc changer and the 1-disc random feature would be fine. Something to consider...
POSITIVE	I had no idea what a pool hook was. I ordered this item for my son for Christmas. It arrived when expected and without damage. It was even better than what he expected. Thanks!
NEGATIVE	Like most all the other reviews, surprisingly this product from Sony (made in Sweden) does not perform well at all, period.Even though I too read the other reviews here before buying, I hoped they were wrong and I went ahead and purchased this item. Don't waste your time.It does work, but it has to be right near the radio source, but even then it gives you static. On top of that, it uses alot of power from your phone battery. Great idea, but Sony needs to go back to the drawing board on this one.
POSITIVE	recieved on time and in good shape. great recording of this music. thanks a lot. bobby vintons 36 all time greatest hits
POSITIVE	Rough, but melodic punk rock from D.C. This is the best punk rock record that was released in 1998. Amazing.
POSITIVE	I loved this series growing up! Huge fan of the British humor. It's good ole DM, but not quite as good as earlier seasons.
NEGATIVE	This quality of this film reminds me of a home movie. In the lenght of approx 38 minutes alot of route 66 was left out including twin arrows, one of best known landmarks of route 66. I would not recommend this video to anyone.
NEGATIVE	this movie stinks i strongly dislike joels batman movies i prefer the tim burton batman movies and the chris nolans batman trilogy this movie stinks jim carrey is overacting same with tommy lee jones the only good person in this movie were val kilmer and nicole kidman but even those two could not save this terrible movie and robin does not even look like robin in this frikin movie the actor they choose to play robin was not even the right age to play robin thanks joel schumacher for almost destroying the batman movie frenchise with batman forever and batman & robin
POSITIVE	I loved this book and will read this author again. This is a story of women's triumphs, of celebrating who we are and of our courage to live, love, lose and love again.
POSITIVE	I am not going to write a big review of this compilation, because to be honest, I don't really listen to it all that much. There are some decent cover versions of Cure classics, to be sure.But if you are a Dismemberment Plan fan, you must get this to hear their version of Close to Me. It's really unbelievable. Not only a great cover of this Cure song, but stands out uniquely among DP's catalog. I sent DP an email requesting they play this at one of their last concerts before breaking up. One of the band responded that it would be impossible for them to perform without 2 turntablists on stage with them... hopefully that's enough to catch your curiosity at least.
POSITIVE	Didn't think I could find it online when I bought this, But this company came through for me and for that I am greatful. 5 Stars
POSITIVE	The last installment to Night Angel 9 is just what I thought when I bought it. Peter has done a great job job in writing how they work and carry out their job. Great Job!
POSITIVE	"I heard ""Who Will Love Me As I Am?"" on a talk show and I immediately fell in love with the combination of these two women's voices. Unfortunately, some of the songs are a little odd, but when it comes to ""Broadway"" songs, along with ""Who Will Love Me..."", ""I Will Never Leave You"" is powerful and beautiful. These two women better have another theatre vehicle soon! It would be such a waste if they don't work on another show together. The other cd's which they've released are on my list for my birthday. I know that I won't be disappointed. Too bad the show wasn't given the chance that it deserved."
NEGATIVE	It's always been my personal belief that if you aren't going to stay true to a novel, then you shouldn't make a movie about it. This movie was in no way, shape, or form either The Vampire Lestat or The Queen of the Damned. It was a pathetic attempt to gather some actors together, have them hiss and bare their fangs, and play music. The producers should never have tried to make this movie. They have no concept of being true to a novel, of characterization, or even of the concept of a plot.
POSITIVE	This succinct (the text is only about 99 pages), very readable book makes an excellent case for former colonial powers to prioritize access to records. I wish Bastian had spent more time discussing the role of oral history in the absence of written records. A must-read for anyone interested in archival access policy, although the retail price is shockingly high for the book's length.
NEGATIVE	I began this book expecting it to be supremely deep and completely understandable. What I found was that Holden was a pain in the rear teenage boy whose mission in life was to complain about everything except his stupid red hat. I was sorely disappointed.As I got deeper into the book, the more I wanted to just beat some sense into the boy for being such a complainer. He thinks that the world should bow down to him and it just doesn't work that way.I also don't understand why this book was banned. Holden has feelings that every teenager has and complains about everything. How is that different or bothering in any way? We have to go through it everyday, why not be allowed to read about it? Read it if you want, but please tell me if you find the point that makes this book so important.
POSITIVE	A fascinating book, wonderfully written, that was completely different to anything I expected. Hard and harsh, yet at the same time full of hope and joy, however hidden these may be by the struggles the plague brings to an English village.
NEGATIVE	Who listens to this tripe anyway? RADIOHEAD is what you get if you castrated Maynard James Keenan. This album should be packaged with No-DoZ pills.
NEGATIVE	bought this last year. Tried it on a sick coughing kid. Never had to refil the tank. Tried it again last night. Water level didn't drop at all after running it for 15 hours. Now I realize why I never filled the tank last time. It doesn't put out any water.
POSITIVE	this is a great book.plenty of action.for this price you geta lot of stories.you can see howthe charactors growswith the times.
NEGATIVE	This solo effort by Walter Becker showcases alot of what he brought to Steel Dan's music. The rhythms from the guitars and drums are quite funky in a slightly unusual way. The special effects particularly on Hard Up Case, Lucky Henry, and Hat Too Flat are quite interesting. However, most of the songs are very identical in song structure and style. Most of the songs consist of a few chords usually with the same progression repeated over and over again. Pretty annoying after a while. In addition, Walter seems to sing each song in the same manner. Furthermore, most if not all the songs seems to have a sleazy overtone to it. Just read the titles. After a while, this can really drain on any listener. There are a few worthwhile cuts(Down At The Bottom, Junkie Girl, Hat Too Flat, Book Of Liars) and a few good moments here and there among the remaining eight tracks. However, when compared to any of Steely Dan or Donald Fagen recordings, it rates as its title suggests.
POSITIVE	Voice of Silence is a treasure, a gently spiritual book about the major choices we make, often the result of some kind of pain, and how they shape our life path. Oonaugh is a gifted person and her book is a journey into people's gifts. Highly recommend.
POSITIVE	With the gas shortage from sandy and the need to put gas in my car from a 5 gallon gas can I need a funnel. This one is great. It is flexable and goes in the gas tank with ease. The spout is large enough to allow you to pour in the gas without stopping evry few seconds. Worth the money to have just in case.
POSITIVE	Great CD, it still has that big-screen feel of their debut. Nothing is small on this album. They have a their own sound that makes me think of orchestras. Would definitely recommend buying it. Am giving 4 stars not 5 because it's not as amazing as their EP. After 'no cars go', nothing on this album quite hits me the same way.
NEGATIVE	This is a recording of a scratchy LP. I should be allowed to return it, especially since the samples are not scratchy and therefore misleading.
POSITIVE	I have been searching for an ipod nano case for a long time. Every one I tried for some reason or another just wasn't right. I tried leather, socks, etc. This one fits well, is durable and each to use, plus it looks nice.
NEGATIVE	the acting was terrible (the only decent actor in the cast was Michael Ironside). the plot line was NOT true to the Bible (excuse me, isn't the tribulation supposed to last 7 years?) it wasn't even true to the Bible Code (what was all this gunk about 'the last line of code'? all the bible code does is pull from what's already in the Bible) if you want to read a good story about this subject, i highly recommend the LEFT BEHIND series (most of the plot and characters from the Omega Code seem to be copied from it anyway)
POSITIVE	Angier ties together, in a highly readable manner, the complexities of the human body very, very well all the while never loosing site of the whole.I disagree with her on a few points. I don't think she sufficiently looked at human relationships as far as she could but, overall, this is minor.
NEGATIVE	I love the candy dish but have to go to the bother of exchanging it because because there are black flakes inside the glass top.
POSITIVE	This series is based on a series that started in 1972. The movie Shogun's Assassin came out in 1980 and if you like the comics you would like the movie because it is a Lone Wolf and Cub story.
POSITIVE	Bock bock bock, bock bock bock. Bock bock bock bock bock bock bock. Bock bock. Bock. Ba-KAWK!
NEGATIVE	I love other Nicolas Sparks movies like The Notebook, Dear John, but for some reason this one didn't do it for me. Wanted to see it in the theater even, but glad I waited for home rental.
POSITIVE	Trying a new solution to store office files and receipts 7 years back. Easy to assemble, hopefully will stack well.
POSITIVE	I've been pondering whether I should get this game or not for quite some time. So, I coughed up the fifty bucks finally and, i don't regret it. This game is really fun, though sometimes repetitive. Great effects, sounds, and missions. You really can hijack any vehicle, and blow up anything, except for trees. Trees seem to be indestructable in this game for some reason. Having an HDTV is the best too because it makes the graphics better. The game is a little buggy and takes some time to learn. You'll have good fun playing this. At least 20+ hours worth!
NEGATIVE	This is the same remaster that Graham Nash supervised in the early 90's, that is available on the current domestic Atlantic CD.However, as Rhino is just commencing a 2006 reissue/remaster campaign of the entire catalog, it would be a waste of money to buy the current domestic CD,and a double-waste to pay that much more for this import.
POSITIVE	If you are new to Struts or if you just want to get couple of examples to get starting this is not a book for you. However, if you want to really get in to how struts is built and how each part works this is the best book on the subject.The only thing is that it explains each part but doesn't give you a simple step by step to get started.
NEGATIVE	After about 10 charge cycles in the Olypus charger, it does not even hold a charge anymore. The capacity was never as much as the original Olympus battery and it continually got worse. It did not cost much but still was not worth the price. I definitely do not recommend this battery.
POSITIVE	I have looked all over the place for this part and could only find a small number of places that sell this hub--without ABS. And this is by far the cheapest. Most other prices were above $200 and a couple were even above $300. I suggest you purchase from here, you might be searching for a while to find a price this low.--SPOKE TOO SOON--READ COMMENT
NEGATIVE	i watched these movies hoping to learn some factual information about the stories of the bible. instead it was more like church preaching with faith based statements. the testamonies seemed uninformed and did not offer much. good movies for sunday school, but a horrible reference for study.
POSITIVE	This is a great book. Its like one of those books in a series that seems to stand out more than the others, and that goes for the cover too.Meow!!Welcome back, young traveling cats, but your duty isn't over! Where's your sister, Squirrelpaw, and what is ThunderClan doing at Sunningrocks? You five cats~but Feathertail is with you in your hearts~need to warn all the Clans and lead them to safety with the sign Midnight predicted. You must, young cats! It is your destiny!Leafpaw, what are you doing in there? Will you ever be able to get out of there? I don't think I'd wanna be in there...SO YOU BETTER GET OUT OF THERE!!!That's a weird way to do a summary...oh well:)Love, Moonfur
NEGATIVE	"Our 2 year olds love the Wiggles, but they actually walked out of the room on this video! Almost looks like The Wiggles are cashing out by publishing obviously OLD videos of theirs as a ""new release"". Maybe its their publisher doing this, but the quality is poor compared to more recent productions, and some of the songs are actually pretty lame (also compared to more recent productions). If you are a Wiggles fanatic, you'll probably buy this anyway, but you'll be disappointed. If you're new to The Wiggles, don't buy this: buy Wiggle Time, Wake Up Jeff, Toot Toot, or Yummy Yummy instead. Those will not disappoint."
NEGATIVE	I've owned this TV for right at 2 years and it started having significant problems not much after the 1 year warranty was up. The red in the picture has gotten progressively worse to the point that no amount of tuning the color's gives what I would call a good picture. In the last couple weeks, the unit has begun to do two things that pretty much put a fork in it. First it will randomly shut off for no apparent reason. That's not the worst though, it also will randomly go to a blue screen and emit a shrill noise at max volume. That'll wake you up. Anyway, if I had to do it again, I would have saved my $1000.
POSITIVE	I have had this shower head for over two years. My wife and I love it. The water smells better ,our soap seems to lather better also.Only complaint is once we got a bad filter. I don't know if the filter was old or what. but if you open the filter box and the stickers fell off the filter it's most likely no good although when they are good they last a good five to six months .You will notice not much water strength.J&R took it back at no extra cost and shipped new one. fortunetly we had a second filter because showerhead won't work without filter which is another bummer,But I would not hesitate to buy this showerhead again.so make sure your prepared get two filters.
POSITIVE	"""Gnarl!"" is the companion volume to ""Seek!"" and probably one of the best story collections I've ever read. Featuring almost the entirety of Rucker's professional short-story output, ""Gnarl!"" includes hysterical and visionary pieces reminiscent of authors ranging from Kurt Vonnegut to Bruce Sterling (whose collaborative effort ""Big Jelly"" is featured here alongside gems co-written with Marc Laidlaw and Paul de Fillipo). As far as collections go, ""Gnarl!"" is becomingly introspective, and can be read as a transrealist autobiography. Rucker creates grim futures and funny scenarios that cover the spectrum of human emotion. Pac-Man addiction. Religious fervor. Microgravity sex. Beatniks and hydrogen bombs. Time warps and deranged aliens. ""Gnarl!'s"" got it all. You can't come away from the experience unmoved."
NEGATIVE	Just bought NCAA 2003 and the InterAct memory card. Played eight games, saved my dynasty and went to bed. Next day, my files were corrupt.I then tried to re-save other dynasties and all of them were corrupt.I'm bummed, I'd love to have the 1000 blocks but if it's not reliable, it ain't worth it.Don't buy this card, unfortunately. You can't trust it.
NEGATIVE	I don't know whether this is me or else but as said I cannot keep this in site and therefore use it, the taste of it is also disappointing
POSITIVE	A quick question. I initially came into some of the songs from Indian Summer on Al Stewart's best of album. It had Delia's Gone, On the Border, and Nostradamus Part 1 & 2 on the best of album....Now as far as Nostradamus is concerned, I only see Part 1 listed on the credits to Indian Summer on Amazon.The Live at the Roxy CD seems to be the same CD as this one except that the studio material isn't listed. But it does have part 2 (World goes to Ryadh) listed on the credits.I want to get the version with everything on it. Does Indian Summer have part 2 (World goes to Ryadh) on it?
POSITIVE	"I borrowed a copy of this book from a friend who said it only had 2 readings.When my ""used"" copy arrived through Amazon, it was like new, even betterthan my friend's. I am very pleased."
POSITIVE	This case is nothing but excellent. And it suits my car perfectly. The quality is also good. Worth the price.
NEGATIVE	This set of cookware is not what I expected. It's not convenient to use because of its design and it should not be called stainless at all.
NEGATIVE	Where to start? How about here. This is a prime example of egregious mislabeling. The first half of this cd had nothing to do with Alpine yodeling. It sounded like the same American guy on every cut. Badly recorded to boot. The second half sounded like it had the same yodelers on every cut, but at least they were authentic and the sound quality was good. Two of these cuts had no yodeling on them whatsoever. ? 'sup with that? Whoever put this cd out had no ethical qualms and no respect for the artists, for there are no credits in the skimpy packaging. Do a little more research and save your bucks for the real deal.
NEGATIVE	Some of the information and approaches were helpful. However, the book reads like a vanity publication, i.e., some over-educated women with too much time on their hands felt like talking about their feelings. I thought there was too much techno/psycho-babble. Perhaps its saving grace was that it made me think about how to approach speaking with my daughter about her adoption.
POSITIVE	I have read all of Sujata Massey's books and enjoyed all of them. Her descriptions of modern Japan are rich, giving the reader a real slice of the average Japanese lifestyle, while still entertaining the reader with a mystery. Her stories make me want to live in Japan.
NEGATIVE	I really cannot review as when I ordered it - it did not come with all the necessary hardware to put it together - I contacted the seller who told me that Kettler would need to send me the parts and that they have been contacted. Still waiting to put this Christmas gift together....
NEGATIVE	The bed was fine until it all of a sudden developed a leak after only 3 months of use. Called in Aerobed for a replacement, and even made sure that they read to me the exact size and model of the replacement. A few days later I get the WRONG SIZE. Because of the holidays their warehouse is closed and I won't be able to get a replacement until middle of January. Their customer service is incompetent and they don't really care if they make a mistake. One of the representatives MICHELLE even LIED and said I DID NOT call in to make sure they shipped the correct size and model. WILL NEVER PURCHASE FROM AGAIN! POOR COMPANY POLICIES. After all the mistakes they expect me to ship the wrong mattress back to them first before shipping out the second replacement.
POSITIVE	Only track I skip is Black Shampoo, other than that this album is dazzling and there is no filler. They took their time and came up with a classic, what all artists should do.
NEGATIVE	I was disappointed in this purchase, because the of the frequent scanning/transcription errors that could have been easily caught and corrected. e.g. AUTOBIOCrLXPHY instead of AUTOBIOGRAPHY, as well as many that are indecipherable. A simple look through the text to correct the more obvious errors should have been done. A table of contents that is linked to the chapters would have been very helpful, as well.The content is great. I just wish I had known it had no linked index, and so many textual errors. I would have shopped around for a better version.
POSITIVE	The book Sounder by William H. Armstrong is about a dog named Sounder and a boy. It was both happy and depressing. I felt sorry for what happens to the dog. I was sad when the father has to steal a ham to feed his family. I think this book is very good!
POSITIVE	Toda la música de Silvio solo tiene un calificativo: mágica.Cualquiera de sus producciones nos llama a la reflexión y nos deja escuchar la calidad de uno de los cantautores más talentosos de la historia de la música latinoamericana.Salud Silvio !
NEGATIVE	"""What's Up"", the catchy song with the acousitc guitar out of tune (which, I always thought, would have been the perfect song for Heart), is the only thing good here. The rest of this album is a mess. Linda Perry has, of course, gone on to better things."
NEGATIVE	The massive instructions on how to convert Quicken for PC files to work with Quicken for Mac should have scared me away, but they didn't. Don't plan on transferring data files from PC to Mac. After hours of converting financial entries, Quicken created category files and my account names that are too long for Q Mac, etc. it still failed. Turns out splits in my wife's paycheck didn't transfer correctly along with other things. Bottom line I've loved Quicken on the PC and wanted to keeping using it on my Mac, however I guess without stating over that ain't going to happen! If intuit isn't going to make these two products compatible, then they shouldn't give them the same name.
POSITIVE	This is one of the best flight sims on the market right now even though it's 3 years old and then there's the entrance of Falcon 4.0. I fly F-15 online every day and it's really great. Flight physics are very realistic and the multiplayer support great because of JCN, a chatroom where you can hook up for games. I would recommend it to anybody who likes sims.
POSITIVE	This book is part of Barnes & Noble's Health Basics Series. The book is well laid out with helpful resources, web links and an Ask the Expert question and answer page for each section. Well worth the purchase.
POSITIVE	I just had double lumbar fusion surgery. My nervousness leading up to the procedure was bad. This book focused me and chilled me out. It gave me piece of mind that here in this bad, helpless situation I could do some things to affect my outcome.Now, 3 weeks post surgery I'm way ahead of predicted function. My bowels are mostly back on track, i'm sleeping better, i have no infection, good strength.Get this book for you or you loved ones.steven
NEGATIVE	Any book that says email is like a phone call and therefore should never be initiated, and rarely returned, by the female of the species is incredibly wrong! Communicating clearly in the online world is a developing art, and a LACK of communication will make the guy think you are not interested and he will move on. If someone interests you, communicate with him... don't wait for him to send you again. He won't.
POSITIVE	"We began using the Egg and Muffin Toaster for a quick breakfast ""McSandwich"" but it is now, in addition to that, the official egg boiler. Simply add the designated amount of water, eight fresh eggs, press a button, and in 8 minutes hard-boiled eggs in the shell are waiting to be peeled. No more boiling water or over-cooking the egg; it is perfect every time. I am so impressed with this appliance that I am now purchasing it as gifts for family and wedding showers."
NEGATIVE	I will never order from you again.Very poor service.You ripped me off over charge me.did not send what i order .check you so called A-TO-Z And you will see what I'M talking about.And Close my Account(NOW) I'll never buy from you again.And I'M going to let all my friends no how you ripped me off.Allan
POSITIVE	Jointer is what I needed and works as advertised. I would like to see an improvement on the discharge chute. It leaves a lot to be desired dumping shavings on the workbench or floor. Other brands are supplied with vacuum connections for collection of cuttings. Delta sells them as accessories.
POSITIVE	It was an okay movie, but I don't think I would want to watch it over and over again. Obsessed with writing a report on sexual fantasies, decent and charming writer, Mark Demetrius, (played beautifully by Vincent Spano) goes about it the sexy way--by doing phone interviews with ladies with erotic stories to tell. His obsession goes from the office to real life and before he knows it, he is entangled in a web of lies, sex, and murder! The plot is fast-paced with one enchanted bad event leading on to a sizzling worse event. And when you think things couldn't get any more twisted, the conclusion blows up in your face.
NEGATIVE	This is just regular vanilla. It does NOT have the special mexican vanilla flavor I am looking for. It also has a bitter after taste.
POSITIVE	I like the finish on this bread pan. It is not too light and not too dark. It has an easy to use non-stick finish.
POSITIVE	A taste of Power by Elaine Brown is a compelling and passionateautobiography which highlights the internal tensions inside the BPP andthe fascinating stories of party members. It is at times heartbreakingand beautifully written.
POSITIVE	This movie has become a Christmas tradition for my wife and I. You don't need the kids to watch this one.
NEGATIVE	I have been a big QR fan since the Rage For Order album, but the honest truth is that this album is very disappointing. I have always respected these guys, but the table turns when you wait almost 20 years for a follow up album to Operation Mindcrime, and this is what they stick you with. It is sad to see that the best has already came and gone for this band. Losing their original guitarist has definitely been a negative for them. Geoff Tate will always be one of my favorite singers though....right up there with Steve Perry and Bruce Dickinson. However, I am still amazed at the lack of in depth lyrics and musical writing ability that went into this follow up album. I think it would have been a better idea to hire some hotshots outside of the band to do the music writing! Maybe albums like this one are the reason that there is still no Pink Floyd The Wall II!!??Ray LowryLimitedAccesstheband.com
NEGATIVE	I bought this after hearing all the fanfare, and reading mixed reviews on amazon. It's obvious some people who reviewed this were letting their devotion for Iggy get in the way of giving an intelligent and realistic verdict. The CDs sound awful, to put it bluntly. On the first disc one can barely hear the guitar, and on the second it sounds like the show was recorded by a microphone that was under a wet blanket. It's interesting as a document of how out of control Iggy's shows got, but it's worth one listen, if that. It seems like Iggy has this huge mystique surrounding him that causes every piece of crap recording out there to get released. The liner notes said he wasn't even making money off this one, that's a good indication of market flooding. If listening to good punk music involves listening to garbage like this, I want nothing to do with it. This isn't the real truth or the best example of Iggy Pop live. It's just pushing garbage disguised as gold.
NEGATIVE	This book is not nearly as good as what I thought it would be. Stopped reading it after the 2nd chapter. Going to donate it or sell it at my garage sale.
NEGATIVE	Bought to add light to my Jeep Wrangler...problem is, despite the picture, these do not open wide enough to clip onto the hard Jeep visor.Also the pivot point is far too loose and they wiggle too much and don't stay in place.Certainly not worth $10, even if they would clip on as advertised
POSITIVE	I was amazed to learn that Mr. MCourt and I shared so many childhood memories even though we grew up in different countries and in a different generation. It was comforting to now be able to laugh at some of the situations that used to make me cry. And to know that it is possible to succeed no matter what our past bestows on us is inspiring. Thank you, Mr. McCourt, for making it clear that humor can be found even in the worst childhoods.
NEGATIVE	Installed on a Pentium D 3.0 Ghz with 320 hard drive. Everything had been peachy keen since I got the box a month ago. I installed the Norton suite amd turn on Go Back and mysteriously my hard drive dissapeared when I tried to start up the next time. Poof. Gone. I had to reformat and reinstall windows xp Media edition. At the time I didn't attribute it to this virus packaged as a helpful program. So I reinstall everything, for the past week, preformance has been degrading. Slower and slower. I am currently laughing bitterly at the box it is on because on boot at 4:20 pm eastern, Norton went all crazy and decided to GoBack! It is now 6:50 pm. I took a nap. The damn things is at 76% and has been there since I woke up. I am questioning if I should just turn the box off now. Possibly the worst software I have ever intentionally installed.
POSITIVE	I bought this kit to revive my Bach trumpet that had been sitting in the closet for years. Everything you need and then some is in this kit. Just what the doctor ordered!
NEGATIVE	Our machine worked well for the first week, but after that began to demonstrate the same problems others described. And yes, we did read the instructions. The lid appears to be poorly designed so that overflow is inevitable on some machines. Also, the button you press to open the valve for pouring was broken from the start. A very expensive piece of junk.
POSITIVE	"Sure, the recording's not perfect, but there's no denying the energy here. For a band usually associated with crispness and precision, it's refreshing to hear Tull let their hair down (and boy did they have hair in those days!), crank the amps to 11 and let 'er rip!I too wish that live Tull recordings would retain Ian's often hilarious between-songs patter, as this as is integral to a Tull show as the musical virtuosity and visual humour.Nonetheless, this album is a lot of fun. Also recommended is the ""Message to Love"" Isle of Wight film--a hilarious counterpart to ""Peace and Love"" Woodstock--hippies gone bad!!"
POSITIVE	I loved all the stories and the way that they were arranged. Autopsy Room Four kept me awake!
NEGATIVE	this is ridiculous that someone would ask this much for any album-----elvis cds aren t this much--AND ELVIS IS KING !!! IT WILL NEVER SELL !!! I D GIVE HIM 15.00
POSITIVE	.... and it rocks! I had never played the original Bust a Groove, but the 2nd one is so much fun! You've got to have a decent sense of rhythm to get this game down, and it's never boring. Well, it would be boring if you play it alone, so make sure you've got a dancing partner! You'll love BAG2!
POSITIVE	this doll is particularily beautiful! she comes with...-streaked hair(blue-green)-1 white jacket-2 tops-1 bathing suit-1surfboard-1 bracelet-1 neckaceand more! hey i want this doll badly! even more than i want the jade one***
NEGATIVE	I found most of the questions to either be too silly or ridiculous. A lot of what if questions and questions that are not applicable to a lot of people. I would not recommend this book.
NEGATIVE	I was very unhappy with this product. I was unable to get a close shave despite using a electric pre-shave face lotion. It pulled at my facial hairs and I needed to press harder than usual against my face to get any type of sufficient shave. I purchased this product to help eliminate the few razor bumps on my face. It only served to irritate my face even more. To top it off, part of the shaver's exterior screen broke off. I would have asked for a refund, if I had not misplaced my receipt.
NEGATIVE	"There are only two good songs on this album and ironically their both ""SOFT""; The same exact reason 50 was dissing Ja.""I wanna get to know you"" and ""Smile""The rest suck."
POSITIVE	Being brought up a catholic all my life, I have to say after reading this book, I'm glad I'm Wicca. It seems the church is no better than the Nazi's. They killed thousands of people not just for witchcraft but simply because they would not accept what they called THEIR TRUE FAITH! The church hasn't changed to this day. It you do not go by their rules you are condemed to hell. The church will always find someone to point the finger at for being devil worshippers. Now they have homosexuals to pick on!
POSITIVE	I haven't yet gotten the CD but I saw this guy LIVEin Santa Cruz and he absolutely ROCKS! If you likeStevie Ray, Hendrix, etc. - buy this CD!Just to make sure, you can stop by Corby's websitefor some free MP3's! www.corbyyates.com/extras.htmPS- Check out this Dave Munkhoff guy too! AWESOME!www.davemunkhoff.com/freedownload.html
NEGATIVE	very stupid and nothing spectacular. I dont recommend u buy it even if u get it for $1.
NEGATIVE	"Mad About You is a fine tv programme... I'm English and happened to catch an episode on freeview by accident and was completely hooked by the sharp script, witty set-ups and general easy raport between the two fantastic leads, Helen Hunt and the fantastic Paul Reiser.It shows how great the show is that I am willing to wade through this unfamiliar American website to see if I can buy all the series... and I am appalled by this so-called ""Best Of"". There seems to be very little in the way of extras on the first two releases, and I refuse to be conned by the studio into shelling out the extra cash for this.It's almost as though the studio is using the love dedicated fans of Mad About You feel for the programme. Shame on you!"
POSITIVE	Hag's voice has deepened by this album and he uses that instrument very well here. This recording is as artistically superior as his Capitol stuff, but with a different sound and different topics. The whole album fits together, from the theme of running from life and trying to forget one's problems, to memories (false or imagined?) of a loving childhood, to staring all the problems a man can have in the face and declaring that there'll be roses in the winter because love is all we have to have (though you know a tough road lies ahead). A great combination of songs, singing, and musicianship. That this is basically a bargain bin album tells you all you need to know about the state of country music today. This album deserves a remastered, deluxe version with liner notes for godsakes.
NEGATIVE	"I bought this item to replace another air cleaner that I was using. This unit didn't work correctly from the beginning. It would turn off by itself and wouldn't turn back on until you unplugged it and then hit the sleep button (pushing the ""on"" button had no effect). It was also EXTREMELY noisy even in ""low"" mode. I kept it in the very lowest setting as a result which meant it ceirculated very little air and was more or less useless.I lived with it for a few months. Now the timer on the screen indicates the filter needs to be cleaned. After I cleaned the filter, I followed the directions to reset the counter, but pushing the ""reset"" button doesn't return the screen to show 100% clean filter. After two days of trying the screen still flashes 0% and indicates the filter should be replaced.Now that the unit refuses to turn back on at all, so I guess it is going to the trash can."
NEGATIVE	...NOT ONLY IS THIS STUFF STINKY AND OVERPRICED, IT MAKES A GIANT STICKY MESS.Just like everyone here my daughter pestered me for a long time to buy it and I bought her the REAL FLOAM.It was a huge disappointment since she couldn't even get around to enjoy it...SHE WAS TOO PREOCCUPIED WITH TRYING TO GET IT TO STOP STICKING TO HER FINGERS AND HANDS. After 10 minutes of her complaining and getting frustrated it I pitched into the trash.A TOTAL WASTE OF $ AND TIME!!!!!IF I COULD GIVE IT A 0 OUT OF 5 STARS I WOULD.
NEGATIVE	This set is absolutely horrible. I have used several different language tapes for brushing up on my Spanish. This one is not only bad, it's extremely irritating!Problem 1: The cover says that there are 2 tracks, 1 for Spanish and 1 for English. So, You choose to listen to 1, or both tracks. Wrong! No matter how I turned the dials on my stereo, I heard both tracks.Problem 2: The tracks are so rapid that it is difficult to tell what is being said.Problem 3: Each of the 4 speakers talks at a different volume level. One moment you can't hear, and the next moment your'e being screached at.Problem 4: (Last and certainly not least) An annoying high-pitched set of tones is played between EVERY section. This repeated shrill sound is enough to give you a headache! Sometimes the sections are short so you get to hear this sound after only a few phrases!Avoid this package at all costs!!!
POSITIVE	This is a fantastic toy. LeapFrog has done it again. I don't typically write reviews - however this is an incredible toy. My daughter will sit and play with it for hours (she is 3) and my son who is about to turn 2 can also work it and fights her for it constantly. He sits and sings the ABC's with the computer. Of all the toys we bought for Christmas this is the best. Very kid friendly and educational. If you are looking for a great gift for a little girl that will be fun and educational - look no further.
NEGATIVE	this is not worth buying none of the episodes were worth seeing you have to spend alot of money for nothing good they had to dub a whole season and many other parts in one part in season 1 really 2 cause the dub rex challenged joey to a duel and have it where yugi cant help him by cheering him on tristain cept saying no joey got mad and punched him but all they showed was he fell down with bruises i mean come on im 11 and i wanna see everthing encluding the deleted parts so i am going to wait for the deleted scenes because that is what i think is really worth buying.
POSITIVE	If you love Caron (like I do), you must have this CD. It's not Caron perfection, but it's still pretty good. I read the only other review for this recording and found it unduly harsh. Yes, a lot more synth/synth bass and sequencing on this one, but worth listening to.
NEGATIVE	I wanted to like this memoir, wanted to like the author, but after the 50th endless description of vomiting out food he doesn't care for, I'd had just about enough. It's very sad that his mother died, but she the fact that he brings up being molested by strangers and not strangers--in passing--is extremely creepy and disturbing.
POSITIVE	I love this CD, Clay is on his way to becoming a superstar. It is unfortunate he was robbed from his American Idol Title. Everyone I talk to knows he should have won. His record sales will prove to America who should have really been the next American Idol.
NEGATIVE	"Here are some of my favorite Ann Coulter quotes that only proves the point that she knows nothing about politics and is a hack job just to make conservatives feel better about their views.""Liberals hate America""""Liberals hate all religion except Islam""""Democrats actually hate working class people""""Liberals hate society""""Even Islamic terrorists don't hate America like liberals do""Democrats will destroy anyone who stands in their way. All that matters to them is power""""Liberals can't just come out and say they want to take more of our money, kill babies, and discriminate on the basis of race""""liberals seek to destroy sexual differentiation in order to destroy morality""""That's the whole point of being a liberal: to feel superior to people with less money""""Liberals are crazy""Don't expect any of these quotes to make any sense at all. They were all written by Ann Coulter."
POSITIVE	One of the best books for the study and practice of Arya Tara, very few other texts can compare to this, and it was one of the first books translated for use in Tibetan Buddhism.
NEGATIVE	For my last child I had to use nipple shields for a while and they worked fine. I don't know if my experience is unique- but I just ordered these with my second child and they were far to big for her- they made her gag. Could not continue use of product.
NEGATIVE	This book was a total disappointment. It was completely predictable and quite boring unless you like to be entertained by the sexual descriptions. I must have missed something in this story as many past readers have raved about this book. I just thought it was a pretty weak plot.
POSITIVE	One of my favorite films so defining of the 80's. A classic teen angst high school movie but with imagination. I think Corey Feldman & Corey Haim made a great team in this. This film makes you want to go back to the 80's. I was just going into high school at the time this release in theaters .Watching it nowadays I completely related to Corey Haims character Dinger. Dinger and Bobby are best friends Bobby falls for Lainie the hottest girl in school and has to convince her that she loves him before the night's over but here's the story in an accident Bobby switches his body with the old man next store living life thru his eyes and vice versus. The same thing with Lainie and the old man's wife. A romantic comedy with a twist. Pay attention to the characters and their bond. A great film about friendship & relationships in high school. An essential to collection for anyone who grew up in 80's cinema. I own the DVD and the soundtrack is great too.
NEGATIVE	This has to be the WORST book I've read. It was a struggle to get through and I feel I wasted my time when I got to the end. Dr. Julius is clueless and in love. Dr. Conley is an egomanic. I had to skip sections just to get to the end. Horrible!
NEGATIVE	I saw Blue Man Group in a small theater live and loved them. This DVD, though, I thought was a complete bore. Skip the DVD and watch them live.
POSITIVE	My husband uses this and loves it. Bought it for a friend who has MS. It has has helped her tremenously.
NEGATIVE	I read reviews stating how poor this product was, but I thought my daughter would love it since she loves dogs so much. First the cord is too long- it could easily be wrapped around their necks. Second, she doesnt really know to drag it so she just picks it up by the cord and jerks it awkwardly. Third, it is not well made. Basically, this is a complete waste of money!!!
POSITIVE	I can't believe how heavy this set is! I thought my roommate ordered something when I picked up the box and found it was my poker set. Love the clay clinking noise of the chips, great quality carrying case. The cards are cheap, so what. Buy new cards.Definitely the best deal on poker sets with amazon.
POSITIVE	1991''DANCE OF THE DEAD'' one of the best METAL song's of the 90's..and they made a GREAT video for it as well! check that drum work!!BLIND is one hell of angry/erie album that is on the verge of collapse, I dont agree with all they say..but some I do!! so many different style's to this album.. a lot like BLOODY KISSE's by TYPE O..perhap's the SOUHTERN version?? but hell this was made before that album!!Stuff that will make you think and song's you will sing yer self!!ONE OF THE BEST OF THE 90's!!!''VOTE WITH A BULLET'' more relevent today then ever before!!
NEGATIVE	"Movie did great until scene selection 19. The picture froze. Couldn't get it to advance or reverse. I took it out and tried it in my other player, same thing. I then took it to my daughter's home and tried it there, same thing. I need to return it, but I have to go somewhere else and use someone's computer to do this. When I tried to do this from my home, the site said ""printer required"" and mine is not working. I bought several other movies and they all were good, so I am not unhappy with your service. I just hope the return goes well. I have several other purchases waiting in my cart that I will not buy until I see how this is resolved. Thank you."
POSITIVE	"A MOVIE YOU CAN READ!!!!This book is some of the most dynamic, vividly written non-fiction I have read in such a long, long time!...One scene after another puts you right there...you are a part of Evan's story...rooting for his eventual redemption all the way! The mother who never gave up on him..how her love carried him through his prison ordeals, what it's like to live in prison above the electric chair...Finally, an inside view of the Panthers from one of their own...Aside from bestseller lists..when will it be made into a movie?...one thinks of ""Antwone Fisher"", ""The Hurricane""... who will play Evans?"
NEGATIVE	I purchased the Kaz Ultra King Size Heating Pad off eBay to replace another Kaz heating pad that stopped working after 2-3 months. Well, this is no different except I now have more expensive heating pad that is useless. Just like the other reviewers, my controller suddenly started blinking red and would not allow me to press any other button to start the heat process. I plugged and unplugged the unit several times with several long time increments each time. I also tried holding down all of the hear setting buttons for several seconds, sometimes two or three at once. Nothing worked. Its was nice while it lasted-- heated well without getting too hot. It is just a shame that the quality could not last for more than two months. Thumbs down!DO NOT PURCHASE A KAZ SOFTHEAT HEATING PAD IF YOU VALUE YOUR MONEY.
POSITIVE	As a french jazz fan and drummer I think that Lewis Nash is one of the masters of jazz drumming, his musical contribution to the today jazz is very important.This album is a marvelous exemple of swing and musicality, what a great sound and a great feeling....Thanks to make the Jazz lives...
POSITIVE	First, the cover design rocks. I was one of the people who thought this was a paranormal romance, but it's more of a science fiction mystery. It's a darker story about an alien hunter, Mia, who has to work with a dangerously attractive -- and plain dangerous -- alien because her partner will die if she doesn't. It's one of those who-do-you-trust? stories and I liked it a lot once I got into it. I was reminded of the politics of non-humans vs. humans in Charlaine Harris's novels.
POSITIVE	"This book, along with ""50 hikes in Vermont"" takes care of every aspect of hiking I want to do in Vermont on a daily basis.Hiking Vermont contains the majority of short hikes of 5 miles or less. There are some longer hikes of 11 miles or more but if you're driving along and decide to take an hour or two to explore the woods, then this book is for you.You don't need a GPS to find the trailhead, the directions are well documented. This book also has perfect maps of the trail and a nice selection of pictures on the trail. It's my driving bible."
NEGATIVE	"Maybe I just didn't ""get it."" More likely my expectations were different than what the author intended. I was expecting ""hundreds of ideas to spark my creativity"" but got the same number of examples from Harpers, New Yorker, WSJ, Time and just about every other publication known to man, or so it seems. Yes I read some good, actually great, writing examples, but it never came together nor did I get the points being made. Perhaps I'll let it sit on the shelf a while and try again another day. For now, my recommendation is to pick up ""How to Write Articles for Newspapers and Magazines"" - more information in half the number of pages."
POSITIVE	I love this cage. It is pretty easy to put together and my hamster really loves it. He absolutely loves the tubes. He carries his food up to the loft area then goes back down the tube head first and hangs in the middle of the tube upside down and starts dropping all the food into the bottom of the tube. He also does this with the bedding. After buying mine I saw the same cage in petco for about $60.00 so it really is a great buy.
NEGATIVE	"This is the most annoying toy my daughter owns. There are six buttons for children to press. Three that alternate between making animal noises /naming the corresponding animal and playing a song made up of electronic barking etc. The other 3 buttons count 1-3 and name shapes. These features would be tolerable if you weren't constantly bombarded with several phrases: ""flashing lights and music too it's fun playing games with you"" ""roll roll roll the ball gently as can be watch it spin round and round it's fun to play you'll see"" ""so much here to learn and see why don't you come and play with me."" These play when you turn on the toy and when it thinks you haven't touched the toy recently enough and before it shuts off. It is the most obnoxious toy. By daughter will occasionally play with it, otherwise I'd throw it away. Not recommended."
NEGATIVE	Enough already with this droning mess. Don't bother with it. It's for snobs and self-defined aristocrats.
POSITIVE	"This is a really good read. Contrary to what most people say, I don't think the humor is too dark at all. It might not be good for children under the age of eight or nine, but you can tell by the way it is written that it is definitely aimed at ten or eleven year olds. If you people think that kids don't already read about children getting orphaned and terrible things like that, then you're in for a big suprise. Anywayz, its really, really funny. Most writers concentrate on developing the characters and the plot, but ""Mr. Snicket"" has a very interesting voice and technique of writing, so you often find yourself laughing at some very serious parts of the story. Okay, I'm done. Don't hate me because I speak my mind."
POSITIVE	This CD carries like Two Yanks In England one of the Everly's least known albums from their career. Ironically, this album more or less reveals the brothers on a new artistic peak. Very good songs, quite a few written by the brothers themselves. A UK smash hit added to the tracklist with 'The Price Of Love' this album signifies the brothers last hurrah until they released Roots in 1968.Every album has a weak song. I think every Everly fan will agree with me that on this album it is 'Lovey Krazevit'. It is so bad that it makes you wonder how that track even was allowed to be released at all, knowing how many outtakes superior to 'Lovey' had been recorded and could be picked up from the shelf.
NEGATIVE	Unfortunately, the text is in the Old English style that I find difficult to read and difficult to follow the thought. It is all there and likely accurately taken from the original, I just do not find it to be a relaxing read, I have to think too hard to switch words around in my mind to make it make sense. Spurgeon's Morning and Evening is truly a GREAT devotional, but I would highly recommend a more modern translation.
NEGATIVE	"In the past Roxio Easy Media Creator has been pretty good. Unfortunately, release 9 has all the polish and usability of something created by a couple of guys in their garage over a weekend. To start, Roxio forced me to uninstall my previous version (8) but in my case left behind 400 plus megs of no longer needed or usable files. After installation and on first use, the program choked and froze. Three tries later, it was still freezing at different points. The solution, according to Roxio's help desk after three calls, was a fresh ""clean"" install. This requires you go to the Microsoft web site, download a hidden programs control panel and remove all the Roxio files manually, edit the register (dangerous) and on and on. There's more but I won't take up your time. After a fresh clean install, it still crashes. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME. Wait 6 months for a cleaned up version."
NEGATIVE	I purchased two of these products, and they worked well at the outset. During various power outages and surges, they kept everything smooth and functioning. My complaint is that, after having it for less than two years, the battery backup died. It still works as a surge protector, but that's not why you buy a product like this. I don't know what the expected life on this product is, but two years seems too short for the cost.
POSITIVE	I've been listening to these speakers for over a week and am highly pleased. My previous system was a sony stereo system 120 watts per channel. Not only do these speakers have better quality, but they are louder.I don't normally write reviews for products that I purchase online, but I figured since I was so pleased I should share my experience. Definitely use good wires to hook these babies up or you wont exploit their full potential. The RTi's have good bass but I feel like I need to add a sub to feel lower frequencies. When I turn the bass up it's too straining on the speakers, hence a sub.Can't wait to add a sub to this banging setup! No regrets!
POSITIVE	My sisters and I love this show. It used to come on the Odyssey channel(what is now the Hallmark channel) not so long ago, and we watched it occasionally. Then when the DVD came out I was curious to see all of it, and before long we were all hooked! It really is addicting. Don't watch it to get an accurate picture of the pony express--that's not its purpose. Its purpose is to provide a great show that celebrates a piece of Americana, while throwing in some familiar legendary characters for fun! Before long you feel like you know these people--that's evidence of well-written characters and a great story line. I hope they put the other two seasons on DVD!
POSITIVE	I used this to print 67 family calendars. The colors were bright. It certainly lowered the cost. I used 14 pages of colored photos. I am pleased with the quality and cost effectiveness of these cartridges.
POSITIVE	but I love this cologne. It's hard to review something like this considering that it all smells different on different people, but Black Code is a nice, mellow scent that isn't overpowering or distracting at all. I get so many compliments when I wear this out. I'd compare it to a Preferred Stock, but less potent. Black Code is a little more than I'd normally spend on something like this, but it's worth it! While no cologne can guarantee that someone will tear off whatever clothes you're wearing just by your scent, this one definitely inspires compliments from people!
NEGATIVE	Concidering the alternatives, this just simply isn't worth it. Yes, perhaps if you already have the power adapter, all you need is this tip. But in order to use this with your laptop, you need the Y-adapter for an additional $30. There are just too many cheaper, less bulky ipod charging options out there. I just did not find this to be worth the price. However, it is well constructed and works fine.
POSITIVE	Like most dover press books, we have here a wonderful bargain: clear reproductions and good paper stock. Goya was a court painter trying to please his patrons, but in this series of etchings, he indulged his twisted soul in the first recorded anti war propaganda. These etchings are both lovely in their technique and horrifying in their imagery.
POSITIVE	"Nice cd.....all songs except a few r good and meaningful....Broken and Home stand out ....Home has got great lyrics ""In My eyes u c the pain/with each lie i take the blame......""Buy it its a must if you are into rock with emotional lyrics...overall this cd is a 5 on 5... they could hav got better songs than soulfire and back up....these songs r jus ok....running outa pain is a good emotional song...The Way I Feel is another senti song which gets kinda hard in the verse ..""coz i hate the way i feel tonight and i know i need you in my life...."" ...Paul Walker has done an amazing job with the vocals but the bass and lead guitaring is so so compared to other bands like element 80 etc. Also get Let GO by 12 stones from the album daredevil"
NEGATIVE	"I know why this movie is getting so much hype. It is based on only one thing. [THE MUSIC]. That is the only reason this movie is getting so much hailing. I found that the music was the only thing I liked while I watched it in theaters. Everything else stunk! I guess everybody was so astonished by the music in this movie that they didn't even notice the bad plot or the ... acting. I give ""Chicago"" only one star because that is the rating it really deserves."
POSITIVE	"This is a well written book. However, there is a tendency amongst students who are bogged down on reading cases to pass over this sort of material too quickly, thus getting only a shallow apprehension of the subject. The author notes how words often do double and triple duty such that ""You may want to join the bar but may be barred if you fail the bar and wind up tending bar or selling candy bars."" Page 13. Thus, the author points out a critical feature of legal reasoning: ""Legal rules characteristically require interpretation, which is an important part of legal reasoning."" id. I recommend this book for honing those much needed skills in the practice of law and recommend that it be read slowly, not quickly. I also think a reader should consult Martin P. Golding's book ""Legal Reasoning,"" Ruggero Aldisert's book ""Logic for Lawyers,"" and Stephen Toulmin's book ""The Uses of Argument."" (Toulmin shows the uniqueness of legal reasoning in contrast with nonlegal reasoning)."
POSITIVE	If you want to understand the connection between mind and body; how a thought can influence the cells, then this book has the answer. Dr. Lipton's work explains the missing link in the mind.body paradigm.You Don't have To Die When Your Doctor Says: A practical guide to living with grace and joy in the face of a terminal prognosis.
POSITIVE	Are you tired of the daily battles in your life? Then read this book. Franacis Frangiapane does an excellent job of giving practical ways-strategic plans for not only staying in the battle but in overcoming and winning the battle. In the book he reminds us that the victory is already ours-we just have to keep claiming it and fix our eyes on the Lord.
NEGATIVE	I bought this movie and must say I was deeply disturbed by the violent portral of the rape of the actress. Her face being kicked and punched to a pulp was utterly sick. I realize this must happen in real life, and I am truly sorry for women this happens to, I just don't need to see it in my home.Another feature of the film that made me almost seasick from the start was the camera technique of swirling the camera around and tilting it different directions. I guess if one is high on acid, this makes sense?This review is my own personal opinion and I don't expect anyone to be impressed, only hope to help some folks avoid wasting their money on a worthless movie.If I could return it, I would do so, I guess I will hang the CD in my garden to scare away the birds!Save your money and don't buy this worthless effort. IMHO
POSITIVE	Hemingway has produced an incredible account of not only what it's like to be in the center of a horrific storm but also what life was like in south Jackson in the 1960s. She makes you feel as if you were there and knew all the principal characters who were living their regular lives when the weather changed everything. Her personal connection to the story is evident throughout her honest, unflinching look at that day in 1966. After reading the book, I have a new respect for and understanding of tornadoes and their effect on their victims. I look forward to reading it a second time to soak it all in again.
NEGATIVE	Very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, cheap price. Do not like having mandatory written reviews
POSITIVE	I originally borrowed this book from the library and then decided, because it was so useful, to buy a copy. I've worked in publishing all my life and it still taught me some things I didn't know. My husband is now reading it. He is new to the subject, but finding it really interesting and is hooked. In my opinion, the book is suitable for both the pro and the complete novice. The prose is very readable and the information given highly practical. It contains heaps of advice and sources of further information -- a must for anyone considering self-publishing.
POSITIVE	A splendid work of literature which combines expert scholarship with the highest skills in storytelling. It was a great pleasure to read from start to finish. This story would make a wonderful movie or television series.
POSITIVE	The lids are a rather pointless and shabby thing, but the actual mixing bowls themselves are quite decent. They are however, smaller than you think, especially given that you really don't want to fill these anywhere near the top as you might wider bowls. There are benefits to being fairly high walled though, and they are very good for mixing with handheld blenders and the like.Over a year later they have proven surprisingly durable, and are recommended provided you can manage to pretend the lids never existed.
POSITIVE	"This set of songs by MR. Jeffreys has been on my musical playlist since I first heard it. To me it's the best selection of material he has produced. Each song has it's own magic of rock,soul and roots. Here it is reissued on cd. The Lp I own sounds great, Now I can have the digital version as well.This is a must have for Garland Jeffreys fans.""Guts for love"" Is a soulful ballad that asks the ultimate question about love and commitment.Rebel love and El salvdore are top notch selections that will have you playing this cd over and over again."
NEGATIVE	Final Fantasy VIII is too complicated the only really good thing about it in my opinion is the graphics. I still don't understand the stupid junction system or the card game (too complicated). I think the plot was too broken up and jumpy (ie. first you're at school then you're fighting Edea then you're looking for another evil person etc...). FFVII on the other hand has not so good graphics but it wasn't extremely complicated and the plot was awsome. I think that FFVIII isn't worth the money and you should buy FFVII insted (unless you already own FFVII).
POSITIVE	Bought this re-conditioned on sale for $30. Best $30 I've ever spent. If you need/want a 1/4 inch shaft bit router, you can't beat this for the money. I have used it in a router table also and it works remarkably well there, as long as you are mindful of the 1/4 inch bit limitation. I think it regularly sells for $60, and quite frankly, I would not be unhappy with it at that price either. You're not going to build major furniture with this, but if you want to be able to do most other things that a 1/4 inch shaft router will do, this is an excellent buy!
NEGATIVE	I got lazy and bought the device based on the overall good ratings without digging in. I see everyone who bought this device recently trying to use an sdhc card got screwed. It does NOT work with my macbook pro/lion sdhc card. Light comes on but nothing happens...
POSITIVE	Decent quality for the money. While it's a good remake of the original Made in the USA Schrade Sharpfinger, it's not a perfect replacement. Great product for the buck.
NEGATIVE	I bought both on DVD and will not buy them twice again even though I would like to have the option to watch either! These movies are awesome but clearly the marketing folk are in the camp of Mordor!
POSITIVE	Whatever happened to Steve's long acoustic solo that was part of the VH1 broadcast? It is not included on the DVD and it's one of the best parts of the show ?
NEGATIVE	Let's look at the results: over 100,000,000 killed and countless imprisoned, and an ideology for the Democratic Party. This is from a man who had nothing better to do than impregnate his maid (who he never paid) while watching his own children starve to death (why didn't he get a job?). Let's face facts, communism is for people who do not want to work or contribute anything to society, but only want to engage in their selfish, hedonistic lives. Get real!
NEGATIVE	Who wrote this? This is the weakest Grisham book I have read and I generally like everything he has written. I kept waiting for it to grab me and it never did. And the end where he attempted to tie it all together was .... I was very disappointed. I got the feeling he had a deadline or book quota to meet so he just cranked it out knowing it would sell anyway. To make matters worse I was very disappointed that the publisher would allow a book to go out with so many spelling errors and mixed up words in sentences. In this day of computers and spell check there is no excuse for that.
NEGATIVE	Wish there a category for NO stars.I returned this item. IMMEDIATELY. Cheesy knives, with orange rubber handle (a good idea, just badly executed)half-heartedly attached to blade, with frayed ends that fairly screamed MADE(POORLY)IN CHINA. The smaller of mine had a suspicious black blemish on the handle, hinting of prior ownership. Worst of all -- the blades were hopelessly DULL. Did not realize Rachel Ray was that desperate -- with her franchise right now, she should be more caredful of her endorsements. AS SHOULD AMAZON.And while we're at it, please process refund quickly -- it was a gift certificate, and I want to use it for something decent.
POSITIVE	I bought this DVD for my wife after she saw the movie and fell in love with the love story. It was shipped on time as promised and well protected. Great experience.
POSITIVE	I have owned this kettle for several months and give it a very high recommendation. we used it at least two times a day and it works perfectly. it is a little hot as it contains boiling water. but it won't hurt if you were careful and keep it out reach of children. I like the fact that almost all of the material which the water contacts is stainless steel except the sight tube .It boils water very very quickly! There is also a power-indicator light and water-level indicator gauge which are both handy, what made me most satisfied is the auto shut-off function ,once the water comes to a boil,it shut off automatically !
NEGATIVE	So, I have owned this product for 2 months, and in those two months, the wireless has regularly cut out for no reason for about 4 to 6 seconds every 5 minutes or so. This is enough of a timeout to cause ssh sessions to die and streaming video to halt. So, I updated the firmware, changed the broadcast channel, altered the encryption. None of that solved anything. I tested the product on the floor 3 inches from my laptop...same problem. I called linksys support, and they told me to raise it up a foot...why the wireless can't reach 3 inches, I don't know, but I did it, on a stack of books. Problem persisted. The tech support representative had no other useful information, telling me it was probably something environmental. I highly doubt this to be the case, since I see this problem is quite frequent. If you plan to use wireless, I truly can't recommend this product.
NEGATIVE	"After watching the movie and reading ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,"" I felt sympathy and compassion for Viviane, whose upbringing left a lot to be desired. However, after reading this book, all that compassion has evaporated. Viviane is a horrible, small-souled women who beats and humiliates her children at every turn. There are a few loving memories included in this book, but they are by far overshadowed by the verbal, physical, and sexual abuse detailed in this novel.Rebecca Wells is a truly talented writer, who brings her characters to life. Her gift is such that I read this entire book, despite my feelings of loathing and disgust toward Viviane. I would have been better prepared for this novel if it was portrayed as less of a ""feel good, humorous"" book, and more of a ""dark, emotional, and deeply felt"" book."
POSITIVE	Hi, we purchased the XL for our 85 Lb Rottie and she loves it, and she has plenty of room. I filled it with cedar shavings and she was quickly napping in it. I would definitely recommend this dog house.
NEGATIVE	I want the reader to try an imagine something... this is something you live with your entire life, you know about it - but you supress it. This something is cognition...and sometimes your hunches are right and someitmes they are wrong, but here are some cool stories about lucky guesses! That is basically all Gladwell writes about. He tries to impress you with stories of the rogue general who beat the big bad US, and about the classical archeologist who just felt something was wrong. He tries to tell you about the 1920 election and the most perfect yet ugly chair. He tries to explain that all of these ideas are related to a power none of us can control or really understand. Well it is pretty obviousle that Gladwell himself doesn't understand these ideas, so only read this is you want to go no where and learn nothing.
NEGATIVE	The design of and features on this remote are quite nice. But it does not seem to work with hard drive recording systems. I also can't get it to work with our Sony received. There is a support number, but the hours are 9 - 5, Monday - Friday. So, those of us who have to work can't easily call for help. I sent an email to their support, but have not received any reply yet. It's been three weeks.
POSITIVE	Therapy? reorganizes after a slightly disorganized album (Suicide Pact- You First) to deliver a pretty straight forward rock album. The thing is, they know how rock should be and they deliver here. With their slightly off brand of humor and ability to create some interesting melodies this album just is plain great. One of the most underrated bands in the world deliver again. When will these guys be huge? SOOOOOON!
POSITIVE	When I was younger I had the casette recording of this album. I listened to it so many times I actually wore the tape so thin you could hear both sides (A and B) at the same time. I've been looking at second hand shops for this album ever since, I never imagined it was still being made. Every single song on this album is bound to become a family favorite. Just because songs are safe for kids to listen to doesn't mean they have no use for adults. There are some beautiful love songs on this album. Stereotypical children's songs get old fast. How many times can you listen to twinkle twinkle little star and the alphabet song before going crazy because they're the same tune? These songs will give a much needed burst of color into your child's music collection.
POSITIVE	"Hope that I get to see the play sometime. The music is excellent. Got turned onto Louis Jordan quite by accident this Veteran's Day when our local NPR affiliate played ""GI Jive"" on the radio. I looked the song up at the first opportunity and now I'm hooked on Louie Jordan. This collection is one of the most positive, fun-loving CD's I've heard since Keb' Mo'. It's a sure fire mood lifter!"
POSITIVE	I had Tresor before and liked it a lot. But it has been years since I purchased additional product. What I received doesn't have a lasting fragnance and I have to ask people around me if they can detect the perfume. Most say yes, but I can't smell it on myself. Maybe it is just me. I love fragrance and even put a jot under my nose so I can keep the scent surrounding me.
POSITIVE	I have read so many cookbooks, and never been so impressed. Great little encyclopedia of a facinating medley of Lebanese, Italien, and French works of art. A book to cherish for generations. Every kitchen lover should have a copy.
POSITIVE	"Bob Bennets Small Graces is outstanding. I just wish I had his entire collection.I have been searching long and far for ""Matters of the Heart""I used to have it as a kid, but the tape got messed up.If ANYONE, and I mean, ANYONE has it or know where to find it, please let me know how I can get a copy. P>Thank You Kindly"
POSITIVE	I have issues when I eat salad and beans. This product works well when I take it right after eating.
NEGATIVE	I've purchased this product twice in less than 1 year. While it's very helpful when inflated, after a month or so it won't stay inflated for more than 30 minutes of use. I figured maybe the first one was just a dud, so I purchased another one. I still have the same problem - I use it in my car driving to and from work (a 45-minute drive)...I blow it up every morning and by the time I get to work, it's flat. I blow it up in the afternoon for the drive home, and again, it's deflated by the time I get home. I've had the same problem with both of the supports I've purchased. No only is it inexpensive, it's cheap and not worth the air it takes to inflate it twice a day!
POSITIVE	This book is about three children named Violet,Klaus,and Sunny Baudelare. These three children live with an distant realitive named Count Olaf. The children live with him because there parents died in a horrable fire that burned down the house. Count Olaf wasn't very kind, they made them do many chores. But there is a kind lady that lives next door that becomes a friend at first sight. This story takes place in a city past Hazy Harbor in a town of Tedia, on Louse Lane an unpleasant road. During this story, many tragic events happen. If you're searching for a happy story, with a happily ever after ending this isn't the book you are looking for.
NEGATIVE	"I never use this ""Speed Loader"" because I find it speedier to load by hand. Probably good in a gun fight but for the range, I will use my hands."
NEGATIVE	as I now am shopping for replacements to these pans, I thought I might return the favor of some insight to all of those people who graciously provide it to me. I really liked these pans for a while. I am very careful not to scratch the coating with anything, but the coating still gave way after about 6 months. and no, they started to peel without putting them in the dishwasher. maybe i got them too hot. truthfully i have no idea. they are nicely weighted with good handles and do a pretty great job as far as i was concerned. it really stinks to have to throw them away. if i could just find something similar, without the same issue!
NEGATIVE	I keep reordering this lamp but they keep sending it without the shade.House of Troy DL20-WB 1 Light Wall Swing Lamp in Weathered Brass
NEGATIVE	Two characters are followed. Munch; her scenes are semi readable. Mace; unendurable police procedural nonsense. This is trashy pulp. Irony free, with an absurd and rushed ending. I want my quarter back that I spent on this.
POSITIVE	So far I have used this mixer for making frosting and whipping eggs, with no problems. I know the reviews for other cheapish mixers usually complain about splattering at high speeds, but this has not been the case with this mixer. Other cheap kitchen appliances I have get that burning motor smell when used for longer periods of time, but even whipping eggs for 10 minutes didn't seem to affect this mixer. For a cheaper product, this seems to be a good choice.
NEGATIVE	bonsay buy a birthday gift for my aunt, but never arrived and were not contacted me to know what really happened do not recommend this seller
NEGATIVE	I purchased this in hopes of learning something new about the seige at Ruby Ridge. However, it was only 22 minutes in length, and offered nothing that I did not already know and know well. It was more of an opinion piece, rather than informational. Skip it.
POSITIVE	This gun was over all great but after getting it a few days ago I ran into some problems with the ammo. This happened when I was shooting it with my Maverick but I got some ammo mixed up and this gun is so picky about ammo that when I used it again it would only shoot one of the three darts that it came with.
POSITIVE	What a slice of nirvana from 1968 [recorded in 1967, I believe]! For fans of Rich, I am not sure what the appeal would be, but for Alla Rakha devotees, this is one CD you cannot live without.The packaging is simple, but faithful to the original LP's artwork. All the quality in this one went into the superb mastering work. You feel like the musicians are in the room-and I don't have thousand dollar speakers, folks. Five Stars on this one.
POSITIVE	These were perfect! Adjusting can be tough at first, but once you get the hang of it, it is relatively easy. Speaking of adjusting, these are VERY adjustable. The quality is great, especially for the awesome price.
POSITIVE	"This CD has 13 songs. I personally enjoy 9 of them : Soul Power, Aquarius, Electric Hustler Flower, The Hustle, Come Close f/Mary J Blige, and Star 69, are very funky off top, you will enjoy these period if you like Common. ""I Got A Right Ta"" is alright, but it doesn't do anything for me. ""Liberation"" is also cool and mellow and funky, with some sexy singing goin on. ""I Am Music"" is a uptempo jazzy type song with trumpets going, its alright but I wasn't into it. ""Jimi was a Rock Star"" is a complete mess, I dont know what Common and Eryka were doing, but its some unlistenable garbage that dont belong on any CD. The last song ""Heaven Somewhere"" is a nice outro, funky, slow, with Bilal and Ceelo doin their thing..damn!..then some Mary and Jill. 9 out of 13 is tight to me, when most CDs only have four good songs on them. Despite 3 forgettable songs this a tight Common CD. Recommended!"
POSITIVE	Quality is about as good as it gets - nice featurette interview with Romero. Watch out, however, this is NOT two discs -- you get one disc with one movie on each side. I was expecting 2 discs, per the notation on this site, and thought Amazon had made a mistake.
NEGATIVE	I can honestly say I don't see what all the hype is about in regards to this movie. I thought it was slow, dreary and had a hard time putting the pieces together. I grew up in this geographical region so maybe that is why all in the movie comes as no surprise to me. I will admit that Lawrence's performance is quite good, but the movie itself is not that appealing.
POSITIVE	This perfume is slightly spicy and very unique. I found it for the first time in the airport at Heathrow and it's been a favorite ever since.
NEGATIVE	I've read numerous computer books, but this one is the worst, or next to worthless for someone trying to learn how to use Ethereal, now Wireshark. I don't know how the people who wrote this book can sleep at night - no kidding.
NEGATIVE	Don't buy this Dimension Collector's Series version. The box delivered was the right box, but had the wrong DVD inside. There were no special features on the disc, just the movie and a commentary track. What a disappointment.
POSITIVE	I was relucant to buy this grill because of the bad reviews that claimed it was unsafe, but I have had my grill for over 3 months now and never had a moment's trouble with it. The plates lock securely, it heats up quickly, and cooks the food evenly. Everything tastes great and the removable plates are a breeze to clean - really couldn't ask for more!
POSITIVE	As an owner of 4 other PHP books, I have no qualms in saying that this book is undoubtedly the best one of the bunch. Gilmore's book covers a vast assortment of topics important to every PHP programmer, and provides quite a few great examples. The great aspect of this book is that it serves as both a reference and a means for learning new PHP programming methodologies.If you're debating over which PHP book to buy, this is it.
NEGATIVE	Do not order this kegerator from amazon. It arrived damaged due to lack of proper packaging. Both sides of the kegerator were smashed in and the top was crooked. The packaging consisted of a 1/2 inch thick piece of styrofoam on top and nothing protecting the sides except for the cardboad box. If you are going to purchase this product (there are good reviews) get it from a store where you can check it out before purchasing.
POSITIVE	"This book is the first portion of the book ""Masters of the Vortex"". This book stops at the destruction of the first vortex, where ""Masters"" continues on from there. Standard E. E. Doc stuff, in the Lensman universe."
POSITIVE	"I bought ""For Our Children"" in cassette form when it first came out. My children were very young and they loved it! My husband and I actually enjoyed it also! We listened to it so much we finally broke the tape! Now I am buying it again in the form of a CD. It brings back great memories of my little guys listening to it and dancing!"
POSITIVE	I bought this to extend the capacity of a surveillance system and it worked flawlessly , from the moment I took it out of the box. The craftsmanship is terrific, it is solidly built and was exactly what I was looking for. FYI- This is an IDE (EIDE or PATA) interface on the interior tray and you have to be very careful when trying to match specifications, as the standards are changing. There is no room for (SATA) translation cards on the inner tray. Also , in order to keep the heat down, you should install your hard drives as far to the front as you can so there is room for the heat to be dissipated properly by the fan on the back of the rack.The connections are solid and tight and they report correctly through the BIOS. I am really happy to have found these.
NEGATIVE	These blades are not sharp and shaving is just painful.I should have paid more attention to what the other reviewers were saying... I've been using Mach3 cartridges for many years and I strongly believe these are, indeed, NOT the real deal. Extremely disappointing, considering they're sold directly by Amazon.Buy at your own risk; mines are going straight to the garbage bin.
POSITIVE	Although some of his work is dated, the writings of Robert Benchley are classic humor and should be included in the curriculum of every English class or creative writing class. He should not be forgotten. I bought this book on Kindle, and have been enjoying it very much.
POSITIVE	I shopped around and bought this because I wanted the brass wire bristles which don't rust. Long handle and scraper edge make cleaning up easy. There are cheaper versions out there but look at the construction. This was part of a birhtday gift to my son and he loves it. He uses it all the time and is very happy with it.
POSITIVE	This notebook is far cheaper and of much higher quality than those available at my student store. I like that it's not spiral bound and that it has a nice, thick cover which won't easily absorb water or other spills on the cover or back cover.
POSITIVE	Despite the grumpy review posted here which portrays this video as elitist, it is in fact based on the a series written for United Airlines' in-flight magazine, which is about mass market as you can get. Sure, you CAN locate a Days Inn in Honolulu, but why not show one of its better hotels, such as the Mandarin Oriental Kahala? Most of the readers here are going to pay a bundle to get to Hawaii, and might as well know what the top end of the market, in housing at least, looks like. Only three restaurants are portrayed: La Mer and Indigo are perennial favorites in Zagat, and Buzz's is a simple steak house on the windward side of the island. That said, this video recommends a number of charming things frequently overlooked by people getting a package tour look at the islands: the Mission Houses museum area downtown, Chinatown (although they could have mentioned the lei shops there), Lyon Arboretum and the Museum of Art. You could do a lot worse than follow the advice here.
POSITIVE	"The newest edition to the Dashboard Confessional library is outstanding. When I listen to it, it makes me want to just replay it over and over. ""Hands Down"" and ""As Lovers Go"" are both excellent. Chris Carrabba shines yet again. Compared to ""The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most,"" ""A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar"" is three times better. Every track has something special. Great quality music for the Dashboard fan."
POSITIVE	Me my wife and son set this unit up in about 2 hours, not really any problem. The directions could have been detailed more about some of the steps but you figure it out, after all there are only so many parts. The only problem was putting in the sand which I opted for because you won't get the weight you need out of water. We knocked this out in about 45 min. with the help of a large homemade funnel and a lot of shaking as the sand goes in. The manufacturer should have made a better/ larger hole for putting sand in . I grew up with several engineers in my family and it should have been a no brainer. I think the chinese that design and make these products for us consumers are just trying to drive us crazy. Anyway piece of cake.
NEGATIVE	Not what I had hoped for. The opening theme is missing, The transfer to DVD is poor and there are only 10 episodes on 5 discs...2 per disc! I would not but this if I knew then what I know now...This is in spite of the fact that I now live and work in France and felt like I really needed a Mayberry fix to get me in touch with my roots....Avoid.
NEGATIVE	This heavy coffee table book was packed in one layer of plastic bag. The binding was broken and dust jacket was ruined in shipping. I asked for a refund but was offered another book. The second one came in the same one layer of plastic packaging with no dust jacket but the binding was in one piece. I would not order from this shipper again.
POSITIVE	I loved this movie. Based on a real life true story it depicts the love offered freely by a mom given to a teen in need. Truly inspiring. Sandra Bullock was excellent in this. I highly recommend this movie.
POSITIVE	Rubber...something we take for granted in todays world really has an interesting history. The race to make this into a functional material is traced in this book. I must say that I learned so many things about Charles Goodyear and his quest to bring rubber into our lives as a product that has so many applications. His early struggles with financial loss as a result of his quest underlines his obsession that would land him in the poor house on different occasions. This book is a great source of learning not only of him but the other players at the time who could see the potential of this product. Its a great history lesson for anyone interested in how rubber came to be a part of all our lives.
NEGATIVE	Bought the Rio Nitrus after reviewing them and seeing there were great reviews along with the bad ones. I guess you could add us to the list of the dreaded upgrader message. Downloaded a couple of books and songs and then wanted to test it with a fm transmitter and it wouldn't turn on. Just clicked away and got hot. Hate to tell the guy who said just use the reset button... must have tried that 10 times. Finally have given up and returning it. starting the search again!!!
POSITIVE	i am only 16 and may be a younger fan of the work of the likes of Lloyd-Webber, Rice,and Sondheim, but i feel that i know a good musical when i see one. Superstar is one musical that will never 'grow old' or fade away, it covers a topic that almost everyone comes across everyday in their lives. The video may not have many fancy lighting techniques or even any flash costumes (save the superstar costumes) but the theme makes it a whole lot more believable and realistic. Carl Anderson has the voice that many man envy, a flexible vocal range that carries the role of Judas off perfectly. Ted Neely, although bringing the high notes to a whole new level,he also seemed too quiet or even frail for the part of Jesus. The cast together, formed a great chorus and Herod's Song added that touch of humor. The whole bus thing was confusing at first, but i slowly grew to like it's symbolism. And yes, the backward glancs from Carl Anderson at the end was the icing on the cake.
NEGATIVE	Late comer in the british New Wave metal invasion and, like a wave without a real crest, it just pretty much faded back into the sea without a specatcular crash on the shore. This band is just horrible in terms of instrumental arrangement, lyrics, and vocals. 'See You in Hell' repeats that phrase at least 24 times in the chorus. Horrible lead singer! This band is a joke! Songs like 'See You in Hell' and 'Dead on Arrival' ironically seem to predict the band's own fate. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
POSITIVE	That was my Tony The Tiger impersonation. Anyways, these are pretty basic headphones that feel great and capture a good sound. Of course they aren't the best, but considering price, I reckon you can't go wrong. I mostly use them for my electric drum kit and they get the job done.
POSITIVE	I wish I had read this book fifteen years ago. It is the fictional account of the great stock speculator Jesse Livermore. The author presents his life starting from the bucket shops through his great gains and losses on the actual stock and commodities markets. There are so many pearls of wisdom in this book that can be gleaned by the typical (loser)investor that the book will probably pay for itself by avoiding the first bad trade. I am only giving it four stars because it is dated, but the psycholgy and behaviours has not chnaged since then, so it is still valuable for today.
NEGATIVE	Unless the author will provide the m files , the book is of very little use. To what avail to see the results if you do not know the solution?I do not recommend the book!!!
NEGATIVE	Do yourself a huge favor. See Planet Terror, with great cast (Bruce Wllis, Josh Brolin, Freddy Rodriguez, Rose McGowan) and by legendary director.
POSITIVE	"I really loved the beginning of the book! Sharon and Ozzy's childhoods and the beginnings of their careers in the music industry are fascinating stories. I can honestly say, though, that I started to get a little irritated and frustrated by their daughter Aimee's entries in the book. When you read Jack and Kelly's entries, it is mostly a ""this is what I remember happening and this is how I felt,"" but with Aimee, she rants on and on with her opinions. She may say that she feels her family is making fools of themselves by doing this show, but I don't think any less of them, and I actually can say that I admire how they've survived all these tragedies. She's lucky they won't cut her out of the dough after all the money they've made!"
POSITIVE	it is a stylish, funtional and good ventilating helmet.i wear it in hot and humid climat, it really improves the cycling experience
POSITIVE	"We saw this version of Black Beauty as a television special many years ago. It was one of the best versions we had seen. We searched for it often and never found it. I remembered that William DeVane was in it and always used his name search as a means to determine if it was ""the one"". I was surprised when I saw that it was available and purchased it right away. We watched it and even though our memories of a great movie can change over time, we still found it to be a rewarding experience in watching it again. I recommend this version of Black Beauty as a good family movie to watch together like my family did."
POSITIVE	WARNING:If you do not want to get sucked into a book, then do not read Lost Souls.This is horror. This is seduction. This is your fears. This is Poppy Z. Brite, and her book Lost Souls is a twisted cocktail of all of the above.She pulls you into the grim vortex of her mind and introduces you to a world where the boys are all pretty, the four main food groups are chartreuse, clove cigarettes,candy and a variety of bodily fluids, and your friends are your lovers and your killers. There is sex, gore, and vampires. If this isn't goth, someone tell me what is. What else could you want in a book?
NEGATIVE	For an office that rarely uses pencil, I expect this thing to last longer. Nope. I think it sharpened $3 worth. That's how much it should cost.
NEGATIVE	this album is a joke. thee isn't a single redeeming cut on it and it's testament to the spiraling state of pop music and the brain-dead A&R folks at Sony... there's a word for it and them but let's just say it's all about money and there ain't no art involved in any way, sahpe or form. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOLKS!!!!
POSITIVE	Last night I was able to get my first harvest and man did I get one! Just from one packet, I got about 20 heeads of romaine and they are very nice looking. Excited to try them since my family loves Caesar Salad! Worth it and so cheap!
NEGATIVE	This is trash, this is not worth the 500.00. You want to trash 500.00, send it to me, I have bills to pay
POSITIVE	Fantastic for its research and accuracy, I learned more than a few things about the illegal nature of the present gun laws and how they got to the point they are today. The last part is a prophesy of what may happen, and it's not at all far fetched. Should be required reading for all legislators!
NEGATIVE	I read the other reviews and bought it anyhow. There really is no science to this at all. There's also no real fizz to the fizz balls you make for the bath. Directions are poor -- to the bath salts you can add any herbs of your choice, but they give no guidance on which herbs might blend well with the lavender or peppermint oils. Then, there's getting the herbs out of the tub and out of your hair....There are not enough ingredients even to make one of each item discussed in the directions. Rather disappointing, actually.
POSITIVE	I saw that this was coming on one night and stayed up to watch it, it looked so absurd.Boy am I glad I did. I ordered it the next day.It's probably R-Rated, if so it's for language and one scene with a girl topless.So even though Ron Jeremy's in it, it's not hard-core porn. Except for the cussing, it's much more tame than your average Cinemax movie.It is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.It's a laugh a minute with some subtle and some not so subtle humor.If you like absurd humor, it's for you.
POSITIVE	Just as Dusty Springfield and Joni Mitchell defined her eras, Shawn Colvin defines hers. Unquestionably the finest singer songwriter of the 90s, I look forward to her continuing as a force in the new millenium. Her studio work, live performances, and now her forays into soundtracks position her as the queen of her genre.
NEGATIVE	WARNING, SPOILER: Clarissa is hounded by an evil young man whos see her, at first, as nothing more than a challenge. then he is obsessed in possessing her even if it means sullying her honor and breaking her spirit. Toward the end of the movie, after many twists and turns, when it is clear that she wants nothing to do with him, and rapes her while others hold her down, something I didn't expect at all. She feels so violated, that she wills herself to die. I hated the story so much that I regret viewing it. Had I known about the rape scene I would not have wasted my time watching this. Silly me in believing that virture will always triumph--certainly not in this story. If you love Jane Austen and all that her heroines stand for, then don't waste your time on this story.
POSITIVE	All you need for smaller snowblower for deck use where longer cord is not necessary based on power draw and simply tangles you up
POSITIVE	"In my opinion this is a valuable book, especially for Catholics who are very perplexed as to how the sexual abuse scandal happened. Both the history and recent events in this area are covered and explained very well. However, the book comes across as one in which independent writings of the three authors were lumped together with very little coordination or joint editing. In particular, Chapter 4: "" The Doyle-Mouton-Peterson Manual ..."" should, in my opinion, have been an appendix, and is a distraction in the body of the book. Also, there is significant repetition in the first and latter sections.Nevertheless, I think this is an important book which should be read by all American Catholics."
NEGATIVE	"I was looking forward to see this concert video; I have a large collection of concert videos and enjoy watching them. The disc itself has plenty of interviews and special features. Sound is very good, a little heavy in surround but OK, most concert video are mixed that way anyway. My main complaint of the movie is the video. The camera work looks like it was filmed and edited by high school kids, the camera zooms and all the jumping around is horrible, looks like they tried to copy the camera work in ""Law and Order"". ""Live and Let Die"" almost made me sick. Them looks good for ""Blackbird"". The interviews in-between songs are annoying to me, an option in the menu to watch the concert and concert with interviews would have been great. I do agree with most posts here that there are to many crowd shots. Overall not a bad effort but not on par to the best concert videos out there."
NEGATIVE	I got this for my daughter last year for $30 and for that price it's fine - not great. I would not spend more than $30 for it at all. The extruder handle breaks off everytime she uses it and it is difficult to clean up the dried bits. The play-doh storage cups don't hold the containers, so everytime she bumped the table they fell out. However, the legs and table top are sturdy.
POSITIVE	These cute little S & P shakers are a must have! Whether you are having a crowd or not its nice to have a little set for each guest. The pepper shakers can't take a coarse grind so I offer my guests the pepper mill if that's what they prefer. If you are having company for a small amount of money they are a great addition. I have given them as gifts, too and are well appreciated.(show up at your Thanksgiving house as a guest with them all filled.. you will be a hit!)
POSITIVE	This CD is one of best, in a long time. It is for all ages, and it truly lifts your spirit. I have bought about 7 of them and am passing them out to all my friends. We are going to the broadway show in Chicago, on the day after thanksgiving and can't wait!!!.thanks amazon, Carol B.
NEGATIVE	Unfortunately didn't notice that the DVD is not formatted to play in Australia and so forth was a bad buy not useful to me
POSITIVE	An excellent love story of true love & intimacy. It is amazing the level of intimacy that can occur when one puts their barriers down and allows themself to be vulnerable.
NEGATIVE	I never did receive the product and I had to ask for a refund because this seller apparently doesn't have the products that he is advertising. Very disappointing!!
POSITIVE	"Before you purchase this remote for use with Canon's Classic Sureshot 120, make sure you have the ""caption"" model. This remote will not work with the standard 120."
NEGATIVE	Installed the product. Seemed to install and work fine at first, but then discovered sensitivity to the start up and shut down sequence of machines.Have called technical support twice. Get a rude message about high call volume followed by automatically being hung up on both times.Don't buy if you really need the product to work in a reasonable timeframe.
NEGATIVE	I was so anxious to read this book and I was shocked by how many typo-s I found here. It was very carelessly edited. For $40 I expected more. A disappointment
NEGATIVE	This company is WAY behind on updated drivers for this device, rendering it useless for my mac running OS 10.8.2. I highly recommend you check their site BEFORE YOU BUY and see if they have a driver online that is specified for the OS you are running. Very disappointing.
POSITIVE	This movie was great. Although, I was kinda disappointed in the ending. It kept me in suspense the whole time during the movie. The music in this movie really rocked too! I'm definitely gonna buy this movie when it come to dvd.
POSITIVE	This is the second book of the Stephanie Plum. I enjoyed it very much and I really like her character. She and her family are likeable and I really love her Grandmother.
POSITIVE	A book every parent should read. A story of an extraordinary family and how they coped with losing a young member of the family. Exploring the raw emotions each member of the family felt and how each individually and collectively as a family used their faith and family bonds to survive.
NEGATIVE	Lyddie is a movie based on the book written by Katherine Paterson. The movie changes the location of the mills! I can't believe that the movie doesn't have Lowell in it. There were so many changes to the story that it became distracting when watching the movie. Anyone who has read the book will not enjoy the movie because it does not do justice to the book.
POSITIVE	"A stripped-down CD, Sketchy E.P. #2 is an eclectic little batch of songs that show Jonah stretching his wings under the moniker of his post-Far project. Featuring covers of a couple pretty aggressive songs (""Savory"" ""Got My List"") he strips them down to practically nothing, only to build them up into surprisingly catchy, heartfelt tunes. My personal favorite is the lone guitar/vocal pop song ""Crush on Everyone;"" it is sheer pleasure.Essential listening for any OLD fan."
POSITIVE	WSC has a pretty good base here in DC. Opening for groups at the 9:30 Club and taking the stage at the Black Cat, they've continued to increase their exposure- which eventually led me to them. I was happy when they put out the cd, because while I tend to enjoy less well-known bands, I dont want them to remain obscure for my benefit.The group is pretty damn good. So's their cd. In addition to their music, they've got a pretty funny vibe, as they poke fun in their songs and at their concerts. I'd suggest you put up the money for the cd, even if you're just curious about them.Oh, and the 5 stars is just cause they're from DC and I've seen them a ton of times. The cd is probably really a 4..
NEGATIVE	I bought this based on the good review rating, however it is a mystery to me why this has been rated so well. Perhaps expectations are low for most people. For me it is unacceptable. During the non-loud moments (playing music or a phone call) you hear a very annoying static sound, similar to the sound of bacon frying. I have tried this on all three of our cars and the results are the same. If you crank up the music and the music selection has no quiet passages, the audio quality is barely acceptable.
POSITIVE	A solid book of recipes, but I wish before I had ordered it that I'd known that it's solely for unglazed clay pot cooking, such as with a Romertopf - and that's actually the pot that is discussed in the introduction. Unglazed pot cooking is great, and one day I will purchase a Romertopf or similar, but for now I have two new glazed cazuelas and an olla de barro. I'm sure the recipes will work just fine; I'm just a bit disappointed in the narrowness of the target audience.
POSITIVE	If you like Limp Bizkit you have to get this.It explains a lot about the band.It said a few things I all ready knew, but most things it said I didn't.
POSITIVE	Bought this movie for my wife, as it's one of her all-time favorites. The blu-ray delivers, best quality we've ever seen.This movie has an awesome soundtrack as well, and it really comes through. Great feel good movie for the holidays!
NEGATIVE	Though the package came factory sealed, it would not play after the first minute. It was scratched and unplayable. I have mailed it back and am waiting to hear back.
POSITIVE	I love these. I've always been self-conscious of my yellow teeth, and I've wanted to try these for a while. Someone told me they made their teeth sensitive for a long time, so I wasn't sure about them. My teeth got a little sensitive about the 8th day, so I stopped for a few days and started again, using them once a day, (which is what the package suggests). They've been fine since then. I tried a sample of Listerine White Strips before these, and they were disgusting and didn't dissolve well at all. I like these way better. My teeth are so white. I love that I don't have to feel self-conscious about them anymore. My husband noticed the difference, too.
NEGATIVE	I have had this unit less than a year. It has been leaking for quite some time and now I can't adjust the water pressure. It is stuck at too low a setting so it is now useless. These things should last longer. I see many other reviewers had the same problem. Junk.
POSITIVE	"These bits are of good quality as is the norm for leatherman products. They will be used little but will be there in a ""pinch."""
NEGATIVE	Needed to get a portable a/c to install some trim on two rooms after some tornado damage. After getting the run around from some flakey contractors, I decided to go and do it myself. This compressor worked for this job and one other small job, and then the problems began, it couldn't pump up the presssure to get the control switch to shut off, why, because of internal leaks. The hotter these units get the aluminum heads warp, it's an inherant design flaw. I've not seen one of the compressors that utilize the oilless design that was worth a flip. They've all failed within 5 years of purchase, most only used sporadically. My last oil filled unit failed after 20 years of hard use, it's replacement has been on the job 7 years without issue. Meanwhile, I've burned up 2 other aluminum headed oilless units, of the shop size/vertical tank design at other farm operations I oversee. Don't waste your money on the the Porter Cable.
POSITIVE	I'm pleased with this purchase. It is a nice compact way to easily access items stored on the roof rack of my Mariner Hybrid. I'm starting to get a little old to try and balance on the door frame while removing skis from the rack. I didn't expect a carrying case, unfortunately it doesn't fit unless the step is as low as it goes and while not difficult to adjust, it did require a wrench and a few minutes. Not something I want to mess with when arriving at my destination - thus minus 1 star.
POSITIVE	I first bought these shoes at JC Penney's and they quit carrying them. I found them again at Amazon and at a better price than I could get them anywhere else...and free shipping! I am on my feet all day at work and these are the best shoes I have found that keep my feet from hurting. They have excellent arch support and extra padding in the heel. Hope Amazon keeps carrying them because I will keep buying them.
POSITIVE	"This 1998 release brought Celia back to the top of the charts with a vengeance. The mega-hit ""La Vida Es Un Carnaval"" became a top-charting hit that got unprecedented amounts of both airplay and club play while letting the world know that Celia's stature as a Salsa music icon had in no way been diminished through the passage of time. While some Salsa purists may feel that this album is a Pop-Salsa oriented set the truth is that it gave Celia a truly much-deserved comeback which brought her back again to the front of the Latin music world."
NEGATIVE	This book is so outdated. Stay away from it. Book is 13 years old. Not in touch with today's internet environment. I bought it for a Domain Names class I am taking. I paid 1 dollar for it (the book actually had a yard sale tag on it that said 50 cents. I guess it would not even sell for that). It might have had a place at one time. It now needs to be retired. Don't waste your money or your time on this book.
NEGATIVE	Book is great, but kindle edition has many c's swapped out for e's. Not unintelligible, but eertenly distraeting, if you get my meaning.
POSITIVE	Aubrey Organics/Rosa Mosqueta products I highly recommend for sensitive dry skin types. The products are lightly scented but are not irritating to your skin. They leave me feeling fresh, moisturized and feminine. Worth the money!
POSITIVE	This is true to form Scooby movie. It is adult friendly, and kid friendly. If you have a younger child it may scare them in some spots, in the beginning my 3year old needs to sit by me. Good humor, good mystery, good movie.
NEGATIVE	I need one to get thru this album. BlechI have heard better singing in the shower from my grandma.
POSITIVE	After reading a review in one of my favourite monthlys I rushed to purchase a well researched and produced piece of graphic literature. A beautiful composition ranging from traditional media(paints, crayons...) to 3dimensional pieces of computer based work. Well worth my hard earned cash.
NEGATIVE	It works fine once you have it on.It's a hassel to put it on, keep it on, put it away etc.The length of the left ear cord is unbelievably short and the other one too long.It gets tangled very easily and the sponges on the ear buds come off easily.Once you have it on it works great. The sound quality is pretty good and the person on the other end is able to hear me loud and clear with no static or echo.One more thing that I noticed is that the normal mic and earphone on my Treo 650 stopped working. Which I suspect is more of a Treo 650 issue manifested by the headset.
POSITIVE	On a new stock spark plug, my lawn mower would run out of gas with about 10% of the lawn left. After switching to the E3 plug, I could do the lawn on one tank and the mower seemed just little bit more able to power through the thicker parts of the lawn without dying.It gets four stars for two reasons:1. It's expensive.2. It seems to wear a little faster than a conventional plug.Despite its drawbacks, I use this plug exclusively in my small engines.
NEGATIVE	Graphic torture. Graphic rape (straight and gay). Graphic S&M sex. If that's your thing, fine and you'll love this book. I'm not prudish - I just expected a good romantic historical fiction. Disappointed, and more than a little grossed out.
NEGATIVE	Man, this book is awful. Wiccans have told people like him that we DO NOT believe in Satan, let alone worship him. He claims to have been a Wiccan priest at some point, but he describes a religion that have no connection with Wicca. I must admit that yes, there are morons in this world who use thier powers for harm, but those people belong to a different faith!
NEGATIVE	"Like many of the people here, I too had to read this novel for school. Never seeing the movie ""Field of dreams"", I didn't go into it already knowing the ending.'Shoeless Joe' starts off like most novels, kinda slow. Unfortunally this makes the reader think that it will soon start to pick up and become an interesting novel. This is not so. The story drags on yanking the reader in different pointless directions. I have a book report due for this book tomorrow, and I'm only 3/4 way through the book. I have lost interest in it and have only made it as far as I have because we have to read it some days in engilsh class. Even then I have a hard time keeping my attention pointed to the novel. I always thought keeping the reader interested was a large part of writing a good novel, apparently I was wrong."
POSITIVE	"It was a good movie and I liked all the actors. My favorite is Hank Azaria and he plays ""Animal."" All it's about is a giant lizard comes to nest (lay eggs) in New York. And the good guys have to stop it. My best friends brother fell in love with it and he said you can ask anybody and they'll say it was a good movie."
NEGATIVE	At first, these fit well and felt comfortable, but did a lot of shedding of black fuzz. The black fuzz looks bad on light carpet and gets all over bed sheets. I washed them to see whether the shedding would stop. Washing did reduce the shedding, but it did not stop -- and the comfort was gone.
POSITIVE	When I started to read this book I could not stop reading it.It's a book about a kid named Nick Allen who made up a new word for the word pen. The teatcher Mrs. Granger was trying to stop it. You will not find another book like this, so read Frindle! (I won't tell you the rest, see for yourself.)
NEGATIVE	If you've had trouble falling asleep, this is the film for you. I hav'nt seen a film with this much action since Andy Worhals Empire State Building. I've worked in Tokyo under similar circumstances and had an exciting and eventfilled experience. These principle characters come off as a couple of dull folks from the USA. Why all the fuss about this film? Somebodies pockets must be getting lined. And I'm a big Bill Murry fan. I'd rate this film 0 stars and 5 ZZZZZs.
POSITIVE	I've had one of these exact pumps in my Drag car for 15 years and I've just now had to replace it due to normal wear and tear. I highly recommend these pumps for any application.
POSITIVE	"I'm a clinical psychologist and professional coach who specializes in helping people overcome procrastination. This is one of the first books I recommend (after titles by Burka & Yuen and a few other authors).Levinson and Greider do a wonderful job of helping us eliminate the guilt we feel about our ""lazy"" habits. They explain why procrastination is a natural and understandable phenonmenon. The reframing of procrastination has been useful for many of my clients and students. Procrastinators are often overextended perfectionists who continually beat themselves up for not being more self-disciplined. This book helps them stop the negative self-downing and provides ways for them to improve their habits.Over and over, Levinson and Greider provide accessible examples of how to make it easier to to the right thing. The answer is not willpower but brainpower."
POSITIVE	Shopped around and this is definitely the best chair for the money. You cant go wrong with this purchase and it arrived in a timely manor.
POSITIVE	"I swear i am dating inspector gadget! he has every little swiss knife, handy flashlight, etc...He is so hard to buy for. So on valentines day i got him this little gizmo as part of his gifts! he absolutely loved it and has had opportunity to use it twice already. he loves the fact that it is small enough to fit into his wallet. anyway - i highly recommend this tool for all the ""inspector gadgets"" in your life! it scored me major brownie points!!"
NEGATIVE	Harem wins five stars for book design, and only one for content. Alev Lyttle Croutier obviously spent a tremendous amount of time finding artwork to illustrate her book. However, most of the paintings that she selected are elaborate European orientalist fantasies of Haram life and not actual historicaly relevant pieces. Perhaps Ms. Croutier should have spent a little more time researching her topic. Aside from some pretty staggaring historical mistakes and gross generalizations about Islam, the book contains very little usefull information for scholars. Most of Haram: World Behind the Viel focuses on a single royal Turkish Haram - with very little cross-cultural analysis. If you are interested in orientalist art or detailed descriptions of eunich castration than this is the book for you, but if you are looking for actual scholarship - look elsewhere.
NEGATIVE	There are no other ways to explain this book but STINKY, PITIFUL, and AWFUL! I sure hope that if you buy this book you don't actually plan on fixing anything specific. The authors of this book raced through and tried to give as little detail about the repairs they were doing as possible.I will never own another Chilton's manual. I suggest you stick with the Haynes manuals. The detail is much greater, the pictures are MUCH better, and they actually tore down and rebuilt the vehicle in the Haynes manual.Please don't waste your money on this pitiful excuse for a repair manual!!
POSITIVE	This is on my list of favorite books ever. I cannot recommend it highly enough. The writing is superb. The plot is interesting and well paced. The characters are unforgettable. I have read this book 5 times and I will read it more. There is always something new in it, something that hits me as relevant to my life, every time I read it. It is much more thought provoking than a romance, but it is romantic. It is more story- and character-driven than most historical fiction, but the author brings you into the world of the past and makes you feel you've experienced it for yourself. Buy it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
NEGATIVE	I set up the swing, turned it on, and then came the loud motor. I cant believe fisher-price makes somehitng this noisy. Too loud for new born and to be honest, me.
POSITIVE	For the price, this kit is a great value. It's obviously pretty cheaply made, but for those who MIGHT want to get into dog agility it's a great kit to make that determination without spending a couple hundred bucks. Would also be a great toy for kids to use to train their dogs. Shipping was quick - as usual. Didn't have to read the directions in order to figure out how to use it. The ribbon awards were a bit overkill, but the rest is pretty good. Just keep it put up and don't leave your dog unsupervised with it. This led to my beagle stealing the top of the jumping bar and running around the yard with it and she managed to chew one end up pretty good, but it still works.
NEGATIVE	I purchased one of these for my son after reading all of the positive reviews. Well, I really don't think this deserves all the high marks it receives. The number one problem with this is that it is not backlit and that makes it difficult to use unless under a very bright light. Second, it seems marketed for a young audience but is perhaps too complicated for the recommended 4 year old age. Perhaps 5 or 6 if your child is advanced with electronic toys. I also found the games to be more than somewhat lacking. VERY DISAPPOINTING!
POSITIVE	I don't know why someone said it smells bad because it smells like a regular body lotion and once you apply it the smell disappears within 30 minutes. Of course it makes your skin red the first week or so and it means it's working. I've tried it for a month and I went from a size 32 to a 30 again. Of course it won't work if you use it one day and just because your skin turns red you discontinue it's use. I highly recommend this product.
POSITIVE	I purchased this book based on my karate instructors advice and it is an awesome book! Very visual and for the most part easy to follow (I did review some of the forms with my instructor and he does a couple things a little different but all in all VERY HELPFUL!)
POSITIVE	I love this music, it is so upbeat and fun! My kids and all my friends just love it too. This is the kind of music that attracts all age groups. I hope to see a lot more of this band in the near future.
POSITIVE	Keeps the frizz under better control. I would prefer a different fragrance and a lower price, but otherwise love it
POSITIVE	If you do not know this film, see it as soon as possible. If you are already an Ozu fan, you either know or will find out, this is as great as his work ever gets. This is quite simply, a deeply moving and poignant family drama that is one of the great works of world cinema. Splendid music and with Criterion, the best transfer possible. One can return to this movie many times over the course of a lifetime and find new rewards with each viewing. For the open viewer, it will provide a quietly overpowering experience.
NEGATIVE	I decided to buy Ipad. It is a multipurpose device that is light weight and had long battery> I enjoy the nice color screen that Kindle does not provide. And if you really want to buy an ebook from amazon you can do still do so on Ipad but not the other way around.
POSITIVE	I find it intersesting that the people giving HTDAAB bad reviews are saying that Vertigo is the only good song, whereas people who enjoy the album are saying that its one of the weaker tracks. I think this shows that most people arent giving this album a chance because it isnt full of 3 minute rock songs like the lead single suggested. This album is a grower, you cant judge it fairly with only one listen, which is what i believe many people are doing. Mark my words, in time this album will get more positive reviews and fewer negative reviews as people realise this is a classic U2 album and see that it is much more than 11 Vertigo's.
NEGATIVE	Hi there,I have yet to receive the Rent DVD that I paid for. The last shipping date was noted April 21st, please advise.I have ordered from Amazon.com before but this is the first time I have not received what I purchased and I don't know how to go about dealing with this. Thank you.
NEGATIVE	Lately I have been very disappointed with Jayne Anne Krantz/Amanda Quick/Jayne Castle and sadly this book is continuing that trend. The science fiction aspect of it was neither smart nor believeable. The characters were flat and uninteresting. The love affair was practically non-existant. (After 270 pages they FINALLY come together, in a boring love-scene that is less than a page and a half long.) It makes me wonder if someone else is writing some of these more recent books, with the publishing house using Jayne's name to sell them. If so, they are ruining her good name!! If not, shame on you Jayne! As an equally annoyed friend of mine remarked to me: Maybe Jayne should stop churning out these formula books every six months and take a whole year to write one good one!
NEGATIVE	These treats are too small,even for training trates.I can find other training treats that are so small.The size of a lifesaver.
POSITIVE	I saw this movie when it first came out, just recently watched it again, and still felt the same way at the end, I cried because I was so happy. This is a great gift for mom's everywhere. Anyone who knows what moms really go through for their kids, the endless hours they work to put food on the table, to make sure their kids have clothing, and how they suffer when there is something wrong with their child or have to be away from them, will want to see this movie.Others may see the issues with immigrants into the US from Mexico but as I have learned in a recent history class in college, Americans used to cross over into Mexico illegally when they discovered how beautiful Mexicans and Mexico are. They married Mexicans to stay in Mexico before the US army illegally crossed into Mexico and started an illegal war with Mexico, The Mexican - American war. Most of the western half of the US used to be Mexican territory.
NEGATIVE	I am a huge Binchy fan and have read everything she has written. But she could NOT have written this book! Perhaps she did not come out of retirement and the publisher had someone else write this using a Binchy 'formula' (it would explain the resurrection of all the old characters)? The dialogue doesn't even seem like Binchy - I can't even hear the Irish 'brogue' in my head - it's all flat. The Ella character is 2-dimensional which is rare in a Binchy novel. And rarely is a Binchy heroine such a naive dope.If Ms Binchy truly wrote this book, then perhaps retirement is the way to go at this point in her life. Quentin's was a waste of my library privilege!
NEGATIVE	Did what it does! Works great, last long and worth the price! no complaints here!
NEGATIVE	I got this in a Metrokane kit, and loved it about three times. It fit into the bottle, seemingly over any bottle top and made a tight seal. Though on my fourth bottle, the twist top broke away from the rubber plug making this product useless. I wasn't extremely tough on this piece and was using finesse. I drink a lot of champagne and wine and love other products that I've bought to open, seal, preserve wine. Although, this is not one of the items I would suggest to anyone.
POSITIVE	yes the item does come kinda smelly. if you put in the washer/dryer you'll get lint everywhere. tag says dry clean only. i got two blankets. These are good for just sitting on the couch to stay warm.
POSITIVE	This is pretty good keyboard, for the price, especially becuase it has two USB ports. I have an ibook, which only comes with two USB ports of its own, so having the extra two is very nice. It was pretty easy to set up too, just plug it in and your Mac pretty much does the rest. The only problem I have with this is the depth of the keys. If you are used to typing on a laptop that has shallow key depths, it takes a little time to get used to this keyboard. It doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but it does slow down my typing. But then again, I probably would have had the same problem with any other keyboards.
NEGATIVE	"Although the production values are up to Surrender's usual glossy standards, the sex scenes are so stylized (and so unrealistic) that they are totally uninvolving. Also, they're simply not as hot as in earlier Surrender films like ""Femalien"" and ""Virtual Encounters"", especially the girl-girl scene. In this film, it's more of an exotic dance than anything else.A final note -- the star, Shauna O'Brien, has unfortunately gone the implant route. Her natural body was a knockout (see the original ""Friend of the Family""), but now she looks preposterous. Too bad!"
NEGATIVE	"My girls (ages 4, 7 and 9) cracked this open, excited to have a new game to play. In the doldrums of summer, they've played Clue, Hullaballo, Sorry, Mancala, checkers and the like. I thought with all the gold stickers on the box for awards and such that this game would be the game to end all games. Um, no. There doesn't really seems to be a point to having the board and tokens other than an attempt to differentiate itself from plain old charades. The whole game was just kind of weird and a bit painful to play (or maybe we're just cranky?). Some of the cards had cute ideas to act out and I did like the fact that my 4 year old could play (with sisters who can read the cards for her), but our reaction just goes to show you can't force laughs. Save your money! This game is going in the ""give away"" pile ASAP!"
POSITIVE	I strongly suggest investing your money in this cheap piece of equipment. I used mine to get online with my Gamecube, which is very far aaway from my cable modem and PC. Once I purchessed this item, I was instantly online at amazing speeds. I strongly suggest this product. What I was mostly surprised about, was the good range which this product has indoors. I am extremely please :) buy it!
NEGATIVE	This thing is a piece of crap. The head was broken before I even opened the box. Couldn't fix it. Waste of money.
NEGATIVE	S H O C K I N G WASTE OF MONEY!!!SHOCKED-because I almost can't believe that BOSS would kick out such a piece of JUNK as this pedal!! Doesn't sound anything like the REAL amplifier is suppose to emulate!As a mater of fact, I can't figure what amp it sounds like-if any amp at all!!SHOCKED- after BOSS dazzled the world with their excellent V-WAH pedal!As for the price-TOTALLY SHOCKED!!!SAVE your money and buy a couple of vintage speakers that will make a difference.
NEGATIVE	"I had high hopes for this slim volume. It did not tell. It did not teach. It merely hinted at something. Not a good starting place. One would do better to pick up the Crystal Clarity edition of ""Autobiography of a Yogi.""Not a good place to continue ones study or practice either. No real guidance in the journey from here to there. A quick read which was mostly disappointing."
POSITIVE	A wonderfull twist on the Hades/Persephone Story. This book was awesome! I have always knew that Hades was a romantic and PC Cast has made him such an amazing hero. He's sensitive and sweet and let's not forget hotter than hell..(pun intended) I loved all of the characters especially Lina the lead. She was a great independent woman who breathes beauty and light into the underworld! I can't wait for Apollo's story next year!!! Seriously rear Goddess by Mistake and rear Goddess of the Sea. PC rocks!
POSITIVE	A wonderful book that gave me a greater understanding of the evolution of religion. A must read for serious questioners of theology.
NEGATIVE	Very nice quality otherwise but the water bottles contain BPA, which was not listed on the description and well after the BPA hazard became widely known.
POSITIVE	This offering from my favorite author is another work of great writing and rich characters.This book reads as if Roy Slater was sitting across form you, sipping coffee and spinning the tale himself. It begins with an unrelated but no less shocking death, which becomes the reason for the story. Roy is the sleuth, a suspect, and the victim. So very well written.
NEGATIVE	The DVD looks like something cobbled togeher by a committee of well-intended amateurs trying to save money on what they put together. The sound is especially crude. The subject, Gaudi's cathedral in Barcelona,is, when seen in person, one of the most beautiful and stunning creations on earth. This production does not do it justice.
POSITIVE	While the story itself was perhaps not that remarkable, I found the characters well-drawn out and perfectly believable. It was well written and enjoyable. Would recommend.
POSITIVE	i find that the foam is so thick that if you are in a warm room it will easily make you sweat. also if you have a bad back this will do nothing to help since if you don't find your sweet spot before falling asleep. you will stay that way all night. this can be very good or bad depending on each knit.
NEGATIVE	I asked two volumes, both paid and receive only one of the books.What to do now ?????????For who complain ???????
NEGATIVE	Sorry I did not like this storyline at all. There were so many things that made it annoying.I don't wish to be negative on this story but a woman searching for her 2nd husband would not risk her reputation to save a new neighbour.After being compromised by entering a bachelors home, she carries on her normal life with no ill effects. Im sorry very hard to believe.
POSITIVE	I still cant understand why in the world these guys never made it nationally. They were big in NY (Long Island area)I saw them as an openig act for RUSH at the Nassau Coliseum 10th row center and walked out after the rats left.This album(CD)had a real Jazzy Rock sound with great harmonies.If you never heard these guys, give them a try, probally the most unique under rated rock band that there ever was.Also try Tasty and Rats to Riches.
POSITIVE	This was an AWESOME book. It was the second that I've read from Coben. I finished it in two days. It kept me up all night, and you'd never suspect the way it ends. This book is definitely worth reading. You won't be disappointed. It is fast paced all the way through. Warning: You will become OBSESSED.
POSITIVE	"I lived in Rio de Janeiro for some 5 years, teaching and coaching in both English and Portuguese .. this book was my suggested ""primer"" before arriving for the first time to understand the wild ""religion"" known as ""Umbanda"" or ""Macumba"" ... I saw most of the ceremonies noted in this book ""first hand"" in my 5 some years in Rio .. often at knifepoint .. often as the only ""white guy"" in the crowd ... it is stunningly realistic ... but returning to Rio many years later, these ""practices"" are all but disappearing .. anyways .. for me ... it is a ""travel back in time"" to when on Sunday when the 99% of the population would visit a Catholic Church, and then light their ""Macumba Candles"" on the way out ... ""just in case!"" Easy reading ... highly recommended if you have any interest in developing Brazilian society!"
NEGATIVE	Not very good. Poor facts and mostly talks about Shelby's and the high end Mustangs. Lots of hype and that's about it. Only good things are the photos which are pretty much stock stuff seen else where. Book is just a belly drop.
POSITIVE	now i can start my campaign in vampire the masquerade with my friends again.it's just really really Great.Thanks
NEGATIVE	John Sandford really misses the boat on his latest novel. Although he continues his masterful writing and development of his characters, the plot of The Night Crew leaves a lot to be desired. I can remember rushing to get each of his books in the Prey series as they came out. But I really struggled to finish this one. I guess I am spoiled by the sheer genius of his previous works
NEGATIVE	"This is a simple book of prayers one could really come up with on their own. A simple ""father, heal my life"" does the same job. If you really want truly beautiful prayers, Marianne Willaimson's Illuminata comes to mind. This book is 3rd grade stuff."
NEGATIVE	"Would have been nice if they were clearer about that - in the description it said ""aluminum, brass finish."" But I thought that meant you had your choice of aluminum OR brass finish. Then I read one of the reviews that said it was solid brass, with solid brass screws...AND I BELIEVED THE REVIEWER! I should know better. But you can believe me - this is most certainly NOT brass."
POSITIVE	This is one great movie. A comedy that gathers it's laughs from characterization and situation colliding in excellent harmony without the use of brainless fart jokes or prosthetic genetalia. The cast is top notch and the writing is dryly hilarious, something unexpected amidst the cookie-cutter comedy that lurks at your local multiplex/video store. Easily Ben Stiller's best movie and Tea Leoni's performance is bordering on comedic genius. For me to expain the plot would be futile, this film should be on every fan's list of funniest films, for it holds a place on my shelf and it is taken down to remind me what a good, funny movie is two to three times monthly. (...)
NEGATIVE	In product detail, it says it has English subtitles, but it's a lie. It doesn't have any subtitles. They're rude that it takes too much hassle for me to return it. I wonder what happen to law?
NEGATIVE	"These will NOT fit a standard weaver or picatinny rail.....they are for 3/8"" dovetail mounts and I just wasted my money. Be foreworned-apparently I missed the 22 part but the description talks about weaver mounts so idk."
NEGATIVE	MAN,NO DISRESPECT TO C,HE IS MY FAVORITE OUT OF THE NO LIMIT SOLDIERS,BUT IN 99' NO LIMIT AINT DOIN NOTHIN BUT PULLIN GARBAGE OUT OF THEIR ASS.LIFE OR DEATH KICKS THE MESS OUT OF THIS CD.THERE IS A FEW GOOD JAMS ON HERE BUT EVERYTHING ELSE AINT NOTING. IT AINT WORTH THE MONEY, GET LIFE OR DEATH IF YOU WANT THE REAL C-MURDER.
POSITIVE	I really enjoyed reading this book. The characters are easy to relate to and the story flows really well.
POSITIVE	I am very satisfied with this device. With I know how far I walk/jog, the number of calories I burn (also grams of fat burned) and the time it took me to travel the distance. I can also store all that information on my computer in the form of an organized chart, for revision. It is easy to use too. Although setting it to zero before an activity is a bit of a challenge even if it comes with a manual. It auto sets to zero at 12 midnight. If I prematually start it and want to get back to zero it does not seem to be able to do that unless you reset it. Then you may have to reenter all your data. Other than that, I highly recommend this device.
NEGATIVE	A wonderful idea poorly executed. This book is trite, shallow, and inaccurate. Apparently to make the book easier to write, the author appears to invent facts -- there's no way to tell for sure since there are no notes, references, or bibliography.On the other hand, the book probably meets the standards of most fourth or fifth grade biographies -- biographies that emphasize action, concoct dialog, and make up dramatic encounters. These biographies also have the virtue of being interesting to the uncritical minds of children. I have trouble believing an educated adult could tolerate this book.All in all, this may be the worst book about science and mathematics I have ever read.
POSITIVE	I love the quality of this beautiful photo paper. Since Canon (make of my printer) makes findinga matte or pearl finish photo paper next to impossilbe, I've found the Ilford paper a great substitute.I use the paper for 12x12 digital scrapbooking pages.
POSITIVE	This is a book with many useful examples. I like it a lot. Recently, I read some coding books and found that they are too theoritical. Applicable technologies should be easy to understand, But I have hard time to understand some of the coding books. This one is a good reference for coding applications because it covers real applications such asGSM, DTV, DVD, etc..
POSITIVE	Although Pardoe isn't as good of an author as Micheal Stackpole, he does a fine job weaving an entertaining story that will sate Battletech fans lust for more to read.
NEGATIVE	I bought this dvd for the yoga as well as the drills - i know what drills are and that is what I wanted. The blurb says for any level of dance student. However, I fond the yoga impossible (I could manage corpse position!) It's certainly not for anyone who hasn't done yoga before. The drills are good but you don't get much for your money as each section is the same as before and timings include yoga. Beginners should buy Jenna Bellydance Basics and beyond for drills and instruction. More advance students might want more content.
NEGATIVE	it has not held up and easily was inferior to the older model I previously owned. I would not recommend it.
NEGATIVE	I did not get this toaster from Amazon, but I have had it for a few years and just sucks!! Burns toast every time.
POSITIVE	"I loved ""Reviving Ophelia."" I only wish I had read it earlier because I might have been a bit easier on my parents. There were so many moments where I felt as though Dr. Pipher was speaking directly to me. If you read the book, you will find that Dr. Pipher does not try to pathologize the adolescent experience of girl--quite the opposite, as she also describes in detail the girls who had healthy teenage years and the reasons for their positive outcomes. I have recommended this book to countless people, and all but one found it fascinating as well. (I don't think it was a coincidence that the one person who hated it was a member of the male population. It is very easy for guys to criticize this book because they have not grown-up in this world as girls.) Reviving Ophelia is truly a must-read book."
NEGATIVE	Movie is really great.. But DVD [stink]s.. There are no Chapters, no special features. if you want to go to a scene in the dvd you have to rewind/FF, just like as you do in VHS. Don't waste your money in buying this dvd, buy VHS instead.
POSITIVE	"This was really easy to put up. It only took a few minutes, and it lined up just fine. When my 2 1/2 year old son first saw it, he spent about ten minutes naming all the characters, saying ""I like trains!"", and jumping on his bed from excitement. It is a little bit transparent, as other reviews have said, but I think it looks just fine on our blue wall. I highly recommend this--my son just loves it!"
NEGATIVE	"I have had nothing but trouble from this camcorder. This is the third camcorder that I have used extensively and the first that I have had any trouble with at all. The other two were Sony products and I should have stayed with that brand. No matter what I do I get an ""E03"" message on the screen and the camcorder shuts down. I bought this to videotape my newborn son and the moments that I have lost because of this inferior camcorder are irreplaceable."
NEGATIVE	For the life of me I will NEVER understand the following for this movie... not even among hopeless and hapless lefties! If I were them, I would demand a much better film...Warren Beatty runs around grinning with his 80's hair falling in his face... utterly unconvincing as a journalist, radical, or human being. Diane Keaton seems intent on portraying Louise Bryant as a sympathetic and idealistic dreamer; she comes off as unbelievably selfish and whiney [probably an inadventent accuracy, actually!]The costuming is horrible. Honestly WHERE was the 30 million bux even spent?? The cut of the clothes is almost always off... hairstyles bear NO resemblance to those of the teen years and '20s... even the dialogue is full of unbearable modern colloquialisms.And I could go on and ON... no kidding.Seriously lefties... demand a better film. LOL
POSITIVE	Fell in love with this Thai paste years ago. I put a big dollop next to my jasmine rice or thin it down a bit with lime juice and use as dip for crudités, shrimp or sticky rice (Thai variety).It is not for the timid. But it you have a taste for the exotic I think you will enjoy it.One problem: a little jar seems to be gone in a flash :)
NEGATIVE	Please do not buy this garbage!!!!!!The Dropkicks try to be english and cover really poor songs by this band called the business who are as most know horrible.Then to make matters worse the business massacre the dropkick songs.They also allow Al Barr there new singer(if you want to call him a singer)screw-up boys on the docks!!!!!!This once great outfit is really stinkin up the bar these days!!!!!drop the dropkicks and pick-up on a new group from boston,ma called the explosion!!!!!
POSITIVE	shipping was fast as usual with amazon. and the cd is very clean with minimal backround noise. I use it as a refrence test cd for high end audio systems.
POSITIVE	Social outcast Geneva Patterson lives a solitary existence...and she likes that just fine. Until, that is, a disgraced Captain Caleb Phelps moves into her small village and turns everything she's ever know inside out. The classic premise of a woman transformed from diamond-in-the-rough to belle of the ball through an unlikely match is made completely new in Morren's novel. You'll fall in love with the book and want to read it a second and third time. I had a hard time letting the characters go at the novel's conclusion. Morren has quickly shot up to the top of my favorite authors list--something that has not happened in a very long time. A must-read!
POSITIVE	It rounded out the series nicely and gave an insight to what has happened to the rest of the characters. In addition, it was nice to see that Jason was still having problems with what happened in Sherbrooke Twins. In so many books, characters get over something like that in a day - one day they are having nightmares and the next night because they have fallen in love they are fine.
NEGATIVE	"I would expect a book on Candida yeast to talk about the importance to probiotics. This book didn't even barely touch on the subject. There are things that people NEED to know (e.g. probiotics can help kill yeast, but can also make the problem worse initially due to the ""die off effect"").Also, I was trying to figure out if brewer's yeast is a problem with candida yeast, and only one place does it touch on it. That sentence basically says that cigarettes and brewers yeast are bad. No explanation as to why...Get a different book on the subject."
NEGATIVE	I would only recommend this cd to anyone who is not a DJ, only because if a dj were to listen to this, they would want to slap DJ Session One in the face. Throughout both of the discs nearly every transfer was completely sloppy, and totally uncalled for from a professional DJ. The tracks on disc one a very good, hard as all hell, i own at least five of them and play them all the time. disc two is sadly pathetic, way too mellow and should not have even been included in this two disc set. like i said i would not recommend this cd to a dj or anyone who is actually into the whole dance scence only because they will be very dissapointed at the talent of blutonium boy, he needs to stay in the studio and off of the decks. when your a dj, your only as good as your first mix and his was awful. if however you are into it just for the tracks and not the talent, please go ahead and buy this cd. reluctant 2 stars only for production.
NEGATIVE	Although the product information says that it is 15 minute recording time -- that is for total of all messages at one time (including outgoing message). Each individual incoming message can be no longer than 3 minutes. When listening to messages remotely you have to hit 6 key strokes to delete a message. There is no battery backup, so whenever there is a power outage you have to reprogram everything. The message screen is not back lit.Update: The incoming message feature stopped working Jan 2013 so I did get over 5 years usage. However, I did not like it enough to replace it with the same one.
POSITIVE	Hey, like most of you, I think that Lila is also sooo underrated, it's not fair because she is really good. She has an outstanding voice not like most other country singers. I personally know because I have a karaoke system in my house and I pop in CD's every once in a while to sing to when I'm bored. Now, I think I have fairly an average voice and man, I can't pull off the songs as good as Lila can on this CD, while I think I'm better than Shania Twain when I sing her songs, because I guess they don't require that much vocal talent and does not have a lot of difficulty. Man, I got to give it up for Lila for doing so great on all the songs. So yeah, this is a great album with a great variety of songs, from the upbeat dances and ballads, to the inbetweens--it just has it all. Want to find some more underrated artists? Check out Hoku and Jennifer Love Hewitt.
POSITIVE	For the price I paid it was with it. I had family visiting and they said it was comfortable and easy to fill up and deflate. They are now going to purchase one because of it's convenience and comfort
NEGATIVE	This was this was my first book on my kindle so I was really lookind forward to it. Sadly, it was cliche in so many ways and the ending left so many unresolved issues. I would like to say more but do not want to reveal anything in case someone decides to read it anyway. All I can say is I would not recommend this book.
NEGATIVE	I was just given the name of the book, not the version or ISBN and apparently I paid quite a bit of money for a book published in 1985. Since it's a textbook on Neuroscience it is quite outdated and not at all usable.
NEGATIVE	i personally dont even think the words pop punk can even be put into the same term. man the first time i heard these guyss i almost got a gun and shot my self.they dont have any self respect. they get dressed up with makeup even. now there teaching our children that they should break rules and crap like that. i certantly don't mind when people break the law, but when these american loveing jackasses pose to be breaking the law and get money on the worlds worst channel MTV i just want take a icecream scope take out there guts.Catagory: line them up and shoot themi hate these guys worse than any other form of music ever
NEGATIVE	Luckily, we borrowed this item from someone, rather than buying it. Don't waste your money. I'm into my 3rd trimester, and I know both where to listen and what to listen for to pick up the baby's heartbeat, and I have yet to find it with this monitor. All I hear is static from the foam cover, interference from moving the monitor around, and sometimes my own stomach. Even when I know the baby is moving and active, I still can't pick up the heartbeat. Definitely NOT a recommended product.
NEGATIVE	Of course, in this mediocre and utterly obnoxious musical scenario we have nowadays (thanks in great part to MTV, the Grammy awards), old giants like Iommi and Hughes, evn when deliver a moderately shineless record, are much better than the new artists.But this album is simply not good. A lot of the songs seem the same, with a dreadful nu-metal style to some of them. There's nothing here so amazing as some reviews say. Nothing here is even as good as THE ETERNAL IDOL or even THE SEVENTH STAR 9to mentin another albume featuring Iommi and Hughes).Mos of the sogns are slow, boring, pedestrian. The exception goes for WHAT YOU'RE LIVING FOR. as for Hughes vocals, of course they are still breathtaking. But the songs..
POSITIVE	Very good product. Compact in size but holds all desired cooking dishes. Electronics are very good and much better than manual spring timers. Toasts very well. Cooks with very even heat. Would recommend the Cuisinart over any competitor.
POSITIVE	Another great album in the Golden Age of Rock and Roll.I ordered the Vols 1,2 and 3 all at the same time. Vol 2 has a few more songs that I never heard before than Vol 1 but still worth the money.
NEGATIVE	Some of the information contained therein is out of date. A glaring example is that the law was changed several years ago to allow the United States flag to be displayed 24/7, if it is illuminated from dusk until dawn.
NEGATIVE	Within 6 months of purchase, center seam failed causing huge bulge in center of mattress, making bed totally unusable. E-mail to company explaining problem and asking for return authorization resulted in them telling me to call their Customer Service instead. Am still awaiting return authorization paperwork!
NEGATIVE	i would like to know a phone number to call an amazon representative because i order a gps on april 27 but i didn't receive yet i made a claim via email but i never receive a response from amazon or any third party this is my review about my purchase.i hope somebody read this and got a rapid response.my email address is wilmar.barrameda@gmail.com[[ASIN:B00005B4BJ Garmin GPSMAP 76 Waterproof Handheld GPS]]
POSITIVE	"""Shane"" is deservedly known as one of the great Westerns.""Shane"" is the story of a gunfighter who comes to the aid of a family of settlers who are being persecuted by free-rangers. There a many allusions to Christ in the character of Shane - his sensitivity, his serenity, his humbleness, his restraint, his self-sacrifice, even the fact he is only ever referred to by one name.Shane is perfectly played by Alan Ladd matched by Brandon de Wilde as the young boy Joey who idolizes Shane, and Jack Palance is appropriately sinister as the ""bad guy"".""Shane"" is superbly staged and shot with great use of foreground and background shot compositions particularly in the bar-room sequences - and who can forget the final sequence. This film more that any other mythologizes the Western. A stunning achievement by director George Stevens."
NEGATIVE	I made this one star because if your like me i dont read too many 5 start reviews because everyone has the same opinion, i tend to look at only the bad reviews, this isnt a bad review but keep reading. I am an ex skater, currently practicing architect. I bought the first version and thought TOny 1 was off the hook, i was a bit leery about the sequel because the developers usually [mess] it up. However, this game is far more better then Tony 1. If the soundtrack doesnt get you into the game i dont know what will, killer soundtrack. The skaters are impecable with more control for the user. I swear playing with Cab takes me back to the bones brigade days!Dude, what happened to Lance. The levels are phat and much bigger. Whoever says that this game [isn't good] should just throw away they're playstation. Hey guys get working on Tony 3, and bring back the other old school skaters.
NEGATIVE	I was pretty disappointed with this c.d. because I bought it hoping to find the original version of Catch Me I'm Falling. This c.d. single sports nothing more than a bunch of overdone re-mixes. You will find nothing close to the original version of the song here. I don't have speakers on my computer so I couldn't listen to it online before buying.
POSITIVE	If you are a true highlander fan --you will love this. If you are new to the game you might be lost. I'm a true Duncan fan and I enjoyed it. Looking for more to come---hope to purchase all the episodes to the TV series.
POSITIVE	This album is an instant classic. Great Beats, Rhymes, and Hooks. If you didn't like this album, you obviously don't know anything about hip hop/rap or your just a hater. Pick it up if you don't have it...A must have
NEGATIVE	The only thing I asked for Christmas was a foot spa. Be careful what you ask for. Like the other reviewers have stated, it doesn't maintain water temperature AT ALL! The water gets darn near cold within 5 minutes. The extra attachments are a waste. It's an overall COMPLETE disappointment. I should have done more research. Now that I have... I'm taking this back and buying the HotSpa Foot Bath with Water Heat Up. All the reviews from all the websites I've researched say that the HotSpa heats VERY well and you can add salts,and soaks and whatnot to the water. You can find it cheaper than the Brookstone which I understand also maintains water temperature well.
POSITIVE	Worked without any major problems. One small issue is that the small cable came out it the connecter and neeeded to be crimped.Most importantly, it also works with the new HD 5 LNB Directv dish.
NEGATIVE	I felt there were too many specific examples. I was hoping for more theory about HOW to make your code reusable. It seemed he talked as much about writing an efficient algorithm as he did about reusability. I expected a bit more theory on what causes well-intentioned code to end up getting rewritten because it cannot be reused. I also did not really understand his pseudocode notations. I'm not faulting him on that, just making a statement.
POSITIVE	Three of Billy Crystal's best early works. Great price. Awesome service by Amazon. Always love doing business with Amazon. Easy to use.
POSITIVE	Dude check it out, first off the drummer is the high pitched evil sounding singer and the growls come from the guitarist.But these guys are bad as F^%$ one of the best live bands i've ever seen! If your into crusty or grindcore these dudes are the best there ever was. PERIOD. also check out Benumb, No less, Ape Face,El Dopa, His Hero Is Gone, Hellnation, Skaven, Phobia, Spazz, Agents of Satan, or Capitalist Casualties
NEGATIVE	Payroll stops working if you do not agree to their monthly tax table update service. Im not cheap. I just dont think my accounting software should stop working if I don't pay every month. Documentation says it wont stop, but it does. I smell class action law suit. Dont put up with this extortion. Go elsewhere.
NEGATIVE	If you are looking for product information (older since this book was published a while ago), OK this will do but you've got to pull the info you need out of this book.
NEGATIVE	Very disappointed that a seam has already started coming lose and I haven't broke it in enough to use it at a game. However, besides the seam issue, the glove is great.
POSITIVE	This was a great book....I love the series very much. Tess Gerritsen spins a very good story and keeps you guessing until the end.
NEGATIVE	There's nothing in-depth here, no good code examples, it's crap, and it's expensixe. I don't know what I was thinking when I bought it, I should be shot! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
NEGATIVE	I think Tony Scott is secretly a woman and you can tell whenever it's his time of the month because it's his time of the month when his movies suck. That's the only thing that would explain how he can make movies so amazingly good as The Last Boy Scout, Top Gun and especially Crimson Tide, and then turn around and make movies as horrifically bad as this and True Romance.
NEGATIVE	The Chinese Connection was the American release name of The Fist of Fury. The American release is edited and badly dubbed. Search for the import release known as The Fist of Fury. The picture and soundtrack is restored and it's formatted properly. The WB releases are sub-par and the import discs are about the same price.
POSITIVE	You can never get bored of this cd. I got it 2 years ago, and it is still in style.
POSITIVE	This book wasa great read. I was truly surprise how the job choices for Jon end up. I enjoy the tour that I went on with this book, places good and bad, just thinking about the food was really great for my mind-eye. Since I live in New Orleans Mardi Gras is something that I know about,the carnival season in the book was great. The way that self-hate and hate of family was display in the book would give other a good food for thought. There were so many characters in this book that it was just fun to read and see how their life would bend in the story and who would feel the effect of their bending. The cover of the book is what the reason that I pick up this book because the male in the far back call to you. Again this was a great read and a fun book to try to figure out, plus I couldn't go to the first chapter and then the last chapter without missing somethings.
NEGATIVE	This DVD is VERY misleading and this isn't traditional spanking scenes like I thought at first. I did purchase this DVD thinking it was agreat buy since I only paid three dollars plus shipping and handling. I also thought I would be seeing spanking scenes with bratty girls getting their comeuppance. The one I had purchased you could barely make out what the people were saying. This is more BDSM theme than spanking.
POSITIVE	It is very hard to accept that OLP have made a better cd than Clumsy, however after several listens to Spiritual Machines... I have to. The songs just bring you to a whole new world. Just sitting in the car on a long drive with your headphones on and SM in your cd player can do wonders. The lyrics, though not as top notch as Happiness..., are spectacular. I will never get tired of listening to this cd. There are so many little things in each song that you begin to notice everytime you listen. Best tracks include 'All My Friends' 'In Repair' and 'Everyone's A Junkie'
NEGATIVE	"I must not have read enough wedding p.rn, because this book was nothing special. If you want to have a wedding, here's how to get invitations. If you want to...do...She said that dollar dances are not grown up. Wow, useful.I expected this book to be about making the wedding UNIQUE for your GROWNUP personality and selves. Instead it was more of the same old ""this is how you have a traditional American wedding."""
NEGATIVE	Smaller than a happy meal...don't recommend... buy some products outright..not in this tiny kit..if you include shipping it was $39.
NEGATIVE	I bought this mascara because I have very sensitive eyes and I thought it was non-irritating. However, my eyes were still irritated but the worst part is that it was very difficult to remove. I had to use eye makeup remover twice to try to get it all off and it still looked like a bit of it was remaining as a smudged area under my lower lashes. A gentle, non-irritating mascara should also be easy to remove and this wasn't. I will continue my search for a non-irritating mascara that is easy to remove.
NEGATIVE	Don't buy this. The performance is treacle like. Even on a brand-new machine, it is hopeless. A great time and money-waster.
POSITIVE	i love the 1st predator it's a classic and one of the best movies of all time. predator 2, some like and some dont. i personally like but is it better than the 1st one, no. instead of having arnold shwarzennager, they had danny glover in it instead. he's a good actor and all (i mean he was in lethal weapon and the color purple) but he's no arnold shwarzennager. i would recomend this to anyone who likes predator but its not near as good as the 1st one.
POSITIVE	this game was fun and all and the controles were simple but there was too many miny-games that yoy hade to waste your time on in order to finish a levle
NEGATIVE	No its not & not even a step up situation for its right price. I have no clue when or why this was released 2 years ago cause it really wasn't supposed to be released until the number of characters where in this game! Theres only 30-40 characters in this game but it was supposed to be originally way more than 70 superstars! Hell yeah it was. Not only that, but the matches where gonna include are Ambulence, Fork Lift, I Quit, & so much more but no, it stinks ass! I can't imagine why Vince & THQ would turn those things down like that as if they're ignoring the fans or something! But who cares, I like TNA anyways! Who cares about WWE, I don't need them neither does TNA whos beating WWE into a ratings. GO TNA GO!!!!
POSITIVE	Mitchell's album is an entertaining journey into storytelling; an introduction for those old and young alike. I think though that this was recorded some years ago, as seeing Mitchell performing is more than entertainment, it's like finding the stepping stones to your soul. And the kids love it! In performance Mitchell shares folktales from all over the world; very interactive tellings that embrace people from all different cultures. I've only seen Mitchell perform live in Australia a few times, but each time has been wonderful! I'm really looking forward to his next album being produced; according to his mailing list sometime in 2002...All the best, and I highly recommend this album!
NEGATIVE	I was expecting a semi-used book. My book was very old and the binding looks as if it is going to rip any second. I'm afraid to start reading it for that sole reason. The Cover is very cracked as well. I do realize the book is not hard cover and is paperback but the review did not say the damage was so. I was expecting to keep this one in my collection, though I'm seriously considering ordering a different one.
POSITIVE	it fits well.. and it arrives on time..now i can used it on my coffee maker well. thanks a lot..
POSITIVE	Plug it in and it works! This has to be the easiest microphone to use I have ever seen. The lighted on - off switch is placed on the base and is easy to see and use. I prefer the voice activated settings instead of using a hot key or the switch on the microphone to talk. Because it sits on the desktop it can pickup vibrations from the equipment when its in the always on mode. I put a simple soft pad under it and the noise stopped. I would recommend this product to anyone needing a PC microphone.
POSITIVE	I almost bought this DVD weeks earlier but, with the mostly good but a few hesitant reviews, decided to wait because I finally had tickets to a live performance and I was already way overbudget. I was fortunate enough to see her live in New Orleans last night (a 4+ hour drive) for the first time. Words cannot describe what seeing Sarah B. live is like and it was more than worth every penny I spent and every mile I traveled! I could not wait to get home to order this DVD! I've already rated it a 5 (even though I have not actually seen the DVD) because I saw her in a smaller arena with a smaller crowd. The people there last night knew who they were there to see and it was one of the best concert crowds I've been in. She got a long standing ovation after Nessun Dorma and that was in the middle of the show...AWESOME performance. If you are not sure about the DVD, go see Sarah B. live and see how quickly you rush home to buy it just to try to relive the whole experience!
NEGATIVE	"Spore is the Black&White of 2008! Just like Black&White, it's the very definition of ""overhyped""! Essentially you're buying a creature creator and a bunch of mini-games. While amusing, the fun factor wears off quickly. Oh yeah, and thanks to the draconian DRM (thanks EA!), you're not really buying it you're RENTING it!"
POSITIVE	This is one of the masterpieces out there. The music is delivered with supreme quality, so the unit must have got many things right! Usually the problem with similar units is that the earphones are so bad that they actually undermine an otherwise good player. In this one, the earphones are top notch. The capacity is decent; voice recording, fm radio/recording all work just fine. Reception of radio is a little problematic, but this is common in all units of this size. It is easy to manage; it reads ogg files; can be used with linux without any problems. The random song list not being really random has been fixed with the latest firmware update.The last word is that it is a unit that you will be proud to own.
NEGATIVE	"I thought I was buying a country record but except for 2 or 3nice songs the rest is screatching electric guitars, 3 setsof drums, shouting back vocals....it's hard rock and I hatethat.The grean CD - supposed to be the Country versions - is purenonsense. It's somewhat less noisy and you hear some moresteel guitar. I just do not understand how Shania is consideredas a country artist. She probably was during the early 90's butafter the interruption of Garth Brooks, Country music changedinto heavy rock and Nashville didn't stop this trend towards it.If you like Country and want to listen to it you will have tobuy remastered versions of artists from the 60's, 70's and 80'slike I do. Nowadays -again- I inmensely enjoy listening to f.e.Gene Watson, Johnny Duncan, Johnny Lee, Moe Bandy, Charlie Richetc. etc. etc. That's what I call Country and not this ""heavy,punk-like pop rock whatsoever!"
NEGATIVE	It simply did not catch any mosquitos all summer long. I saw mosquitos flying all around it, but there were never any in the capture bag. It does not work.
POSITIVE	This would make my forth attempt at finding some headphones that wont fly off when I go jogging. Not only do they stay put while jogging, running and riding my road bike they are super comfortable. These are probably the best ones I have bought yet and will keep them in my list just in case anything happens to these babys.
POSITIVE	Really enjoyed this movie. Bought one for me and one for a friend b-day gift. Well worth the money!!
POSITIVE	Two of the most beautiful whole ducks that I have ever purchased. They were shipped promptly and precisely on time. Very professional, helpful and friendly live customer service.
POSITIVE	it is so real i felt i went through all this and really rewarded myself that i was able to overcome all what bad times i got through and can face any other pain easily and successfully
NEGATIVE	This is an absolutely most frustrating software package ever purchased. Just look at their website at all the problems people are experiencing with it. I haved spent hours and hours and hours trying to get the program installed and then to even run. It corrupted my registry and only God knows what else. Symantec gave up after 3 hours on line trying to find out what the Sonic Cineplayer Decoder package was and whether it was a virus. I have finally gotten everything off my computer by purchasing a registry cleaner software at great expense and am still working on trying to get everything I previously had working properly again. I am sending the program right back to Roxio for a refund as soon as I can get them to give me an RMA. Unless you are REAL computer guru my advice is to steer clear of Roxio and Sonic products. Sonics MyDVD has it's own set of problems.
NEGATIVE	So far I havent been able to charge anything with this charger...I tried to use the 50 AMP selection to start a Mountaineer that had been sitting in the driveway for a while. It set off the Alarm system and never came close to turning the engine over. I tried slow charging and no better. Pay a little more and get a good charger. I will keep it and see if it will charge my mower battery..if not I will give it to someone.
POSITIVE	I like the program's approach to language learning, no stress actually, I take it at my own leisure, it's more fun that way.
NEGATIVE	The omniform forms are touted as forms that work as databases. NEVER use omnform form's built in database. Omniform forms have a ridiculously low file size limit of about 4.5MB and will crash without warning. Calculations such as subtracting time A from time B and displaying time lapsed will not work and return error messages. Not worth the price. However if the company bothers to read all the horrible crash stories,they might think of tying the form to an open source embedded database(which should work without any stupid limitations on file size etc) . The sad part is that whenever Nuance buys decent products they stop developing these products. This includes IBM ViaVoice, Scansoft Omniform. Omniform 5 is a great tool for testing user interfaces before designing database products.
NEGATIVE	I was hoping for more given who Simon's father is, but it seems he's gone down the same cheese-filled road that Phil did eventually. I thought that maybe we'd get to experience some of the innovation and originality that Phil had early in his career with early Genesis and his first couple of solo albums, but Simon gives us something that's OK to play in the background yet doesn't hold up to real listening, in my opinion. I'm not intentionally slagging the guy -- it's very apparent that he has talent, but he just doesn't quite have the creative songwriting tools to make it jump out yet.
NEGATIVE	"This looks to be a great dvd but is in PAL format, (can't be played on dvd players in North America), therefore quite useless here. Amazon should have made this MUCH clearer. In fact their info is misleading as it says ""Region 1, US and Canada only."
NEGATIVE	Reads like a not particularly well researched graduate paper.The title promised so much more and the material has been far better covered elsewhere.
POSITIVE	I too, find thy are much more comfortable if modded. I use a razor blade I cut off about half of the stem from one end and the smallest flange from the other.
NEGATIVE	I absolutely loved the first book. Great characters, great concepts. That book alone carried my through a extra couple books of the misery that follows. Anyone with a scrap of decency gets mauled as the story continues. You are left with the despicable characters. Eventually it gets so bad that you start routing for the least loathsome of them just so you stop being disappointed when the newest character you try to like gets crushed by the game.
NEGATIVE	I'm sure the brads would work great, but the packing left a like to be desired. They arrived completly broken into small pieces. Totally unusable.
POSITIVE	Got this for my son and he is very pleased with it. We always find the best deals on amazon!
NEGATIVE	I cannot stress enough, watch the first one a give this one a skip. I you have watched the first one then you have already seen all the good parts of Teatrino. It is like watching a one year old remake a great work.
POSITIVE	Perfect gift for my son. This is exactly want he needed and wanted for his collection. Thanks for a good product.
NEGATIVE	I put a lot of hope in this product. I didn't expect it to magically eliminate all of the spots that the acnes have left on my face, but I expect a gradual change. In the first month, I did not see clear changes. One disappeared but the other came up. Having read other reviews, I assume it would happen. After 1-2 months, I stopped and started using Origins (serum + moisturizer) and my skin was making much better progress.Last week, I try to combine the together. I used the peel and then put on the correction serum, then moisturizer. Now I have 3 visits from spots, all of them dark and kinda hurt. Assuming Origins was really effective, I have nothing to blame but the peel. I'm not sure if I should continue it or the spots will get worse...Demographics: I'm Asian. A year ago my skin was PERFECT, unblemished and smooth.
NEGATIVE	I thought this would take the mosquitoes away it only collected moths. not sure if i would recommend thisto anyone.
POSITIVE	Little Big Horn 1876: Custer's Last Stand by Peter F. Panzeri is a good overview of the Little Big Horn Campaign. It is written in the traditional Osprey style and in addition has excellent maps showing the troop movements.The theme of the book appears to be the multiple mistakes made by Custer and his men, espically Major Reno, that led to the destruction of his cammand. The chief among these was over confidence. In this vien, the book is very good. This is a worthwhile read for one who wants to know the basics of an American battle where it is often times difficult to seperate fact from folklore.
NEGATIVE	They fell part in less then a week there crap made for a dime sold way over what they should be I might as well have whiped my a** with the ten I spent on this crap go to walmart get real ones for same price these suck!
POSITIVE	A little noisy, but excellent. I chose this ... actually bought two for two small office buildings I have. So far so good.
NEGATIVE	I had hoped that this book would give me ideas for pond or water garden design, and it fell well short. Not worth the money.
POSITIVE	Neil Peart's name may sound familiar to musicians: he's the rock group Rush's lyricist and drummer, and Traveling Music: The Soundtrack To My Life And Times blends an autobiography and musical journey with a survey of Peart's his travels in his MBW Z-8 from Los Angeles to Texas. The idea was to find newfound inspiration in a solitary journey: Traveling Music provides both musical notes and travelogue, charting inspirational sources as much as destinations in the process.
POSITIVE	I enjoyed the music and quality was fine. it was in great condition and the explanation at bottom when ordered was great. I got what I pd. for . pat
NEGATIVE	Lock is not as stated in listing. It is key on both sides. It does NOT have a knob on either side. Key access only both sides. I was very unhappy about this.
POSITIVE	I have been looking for leather pouch on All Home Improvement Store but the Price is just unimaginable thinking what will it be use for. Spending $50 up to $70 just for holding nails,Screws or small hand tools is ridiculous. But this one has meet all my expectations, Of course the bargain Price Amazon has to offer is unbeatable. Got it for $15 with some promotional discount plus riding free on shipping with my order is really One cannot pass. The workmanship is very good, nice seam stitches and rivets. Looking to be with for a while depending on how you use it. The item is made in India so dont be expecting its made here in USA. But dont get this wrong this is one tough to beat Pouch.
POSITIVE	"Great for answering many breastfeeding questions. Doesn't give the ""magic"" solution for getting a good latch but no book would. Could have a better index."
POSITIVE	"Hello!I wrote the reveiw below, and I have to stay, the principles of that book still apply! The series contains tomes on health, happiness, wealth, and love, and I recommend them all! They are not silly ""rules"" such as ""don't return his phone calls"" or ""don't kiss on the first date"" but instead, timeless principles of true self examination and real encouragement."
NEGATIVE	Do youreself a favor and preview these re-issued titles prior to buying the sacd. In my opinion if Bon Jovi released these sorry revisions in the eighties instead of thier originals they very likely would be flipping burgers today.
POSITIVE	ITS WONDELFUL, I LIKE IT A LOT, FROM THE BEGINING, YOU CAN STOP READING, YOU GO ON AND ON, UNTIL YOU FINISH.
NEGATIVE	I don't usually write movie reviews, but this was a huge disappointment. I still can't figure out what the movie was about. I think Tom Cruise must have a twisted side to him to do movies like this and Eyes Wide Shut. And, hey Cameron Crowe- How about a movie that actually makes sense for a change? By the time it was all over, I was sorry I wasted the time watching it.Do not spend good money on this .... If you must see- get it from the library as I did- FOR FREE.
NEGATIVE	Well the funnels are ok and are stainless steel but they are so small I doubt I will ever use them. When I bought them I thought they would be larger. So I got them with my other Kitchen items I never use .
NEGATIVE	I like the work that gilmour has made. Really! I hope you like too. But to use the pink floyd's name in a albun like that... The New Machine (part I and II) it's a prove that gilmour rumour and egoim. There's nothing to suggest the Pink Floyd sound.
NEGATIVE	I've bought a few things from amazon and try to read the reviews to see what others think. But you always have those reviews that say 5 stars, best product I've ever had, and those that say 1 star, horrible product. So you really just have to go with a gut feeling. But I'm telling you now, if you're reading this, not to buy this blender. My wife was using it to make baby food, and after about a month of using it, the motor burned out. We returned it to amazon and got a full refund, but we still are out a blender.
POSITIVE	Anyone who has truly thought about their beliefs must have faced questions such: is there only one faith that leads to God; why is there so much poverty and inequality in the world; why do Christian organisations sometimes misrepresent facts; why are there some very strange Christian denominations; is Christianity true; is God real? Other books and messages in churches often seem reluctant to really pose these questions and express doubts. Michael Wakely, who has worked in countries with absolute poverty and has had good reason to question God, asks these questions and many more without providing glib answers or dismissing them with the answer 'just have faith'! He is open and honest and expresses his doubts without hypocrisy. He is also inspirational in his continuation with his faith in God while believing that it is perfectly compatible to have doubt and faith together. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
POSITIVE	I ordered this product after trying it out on On Demand. That was about a month and a half ago. After fearing stepping on the scale, I made myself do it this morning... I've lost 12.5 pounds! I've been trying to watch what I eat, not eating after six, and doing this video religiously! It's perfect for me, and I absolutely loathe working out. Seriously, I hate it. This video however is easy, and often I just turn on my ipod and walk, walk, walk. I guarantee that if you watch what you eat (I don't cook, so I do the Weight Watcher's meals) and do this video, you will get results! Good luck!
POSITIVE	A rich supplement to the marvellous stories of The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings. Gives the fuller tale of the events in Middle-earth. An essential book in any Tolkien lovers' bookshelf!
POSITIVE	I bought this cd because I like the music by Sarah Brightman and Andrew Lloyd Webber and I would say buy this cd and you will like it
NEGATIVE	My cat means business when he's playing. He will jump 5 feet in the air, grab the toy with his paws and shove it in his mouth before he hits the ground. And once it's in his mouth, pulling it out is a tug of war accompanied by growling and glares. He does not mess around. I've always thought it was a good thing for local wildlife that he's an indoor cat.If that sounds like your cat, then he probably won't be interested in plastic ball rolling in a predictable path. My cat scratched it a couple of times, batted at the ball a little, and then walked away in search of more challenging, erratic prey. But overall quality is good.
NEGATIVE	Even if I had not run across articles proposing that Go Ask Alice is utter fabrication by a member of the mental health profession I still would not believe the narrative of this diary actually belonged to a real person. It is at best highly condescending to teenagers and at worst it is a very sloppy attempt at manipulating people.
POSITIVE	This book could be written abiout today. The dedication her herione shows is somethong more peole should do. ou never know what predicment she is getting into and what will happen.
POSITIVE	I was truly amazed at the reality of this DVD audio disk. And my DVD player isn't a DVD Audio player. I have never heard better bluegrass on any album and I used to play bluegrass on stage.
POSITIVE	This has a really good sound for a tube of plastic. The included reed, a Ricoh, could be upgraded to great effect. It's fun to play, but the fingerings take some getting used to.
NEGATIVE	I've played the TW series since they first came onto the strategy gaming scene. I'd highly recommend STW or MTW to anyone who's interested. RTW shows great potential but the game isnt ready for sale. There are numerous bugs and faults that make this game virtually unplayable unless you can leave the game running in the background. Other less serious problems require player developed modifications to fix. The developers have refused to address the serious problems with the game. Check with the independent fansites and dont buy it until it is fixed.
POSITIVE	This book is great not only for sales people to understand how to navigate sales organizations, but also for those who deal with the sales process to know how you can help, what your role can be, and when there are problems. Part philosophy and part guidebook, I would recommend this to all of my friends and family as we are all, in the end, in sales. Some sell products, some sell ideas, some sell themselves for a job. This book applies to all of them.
POSITIVE	now these are still up in air and it could be from tuneing it with my crossover. i like the light its not bright but its bright enough. love the tweeter. just wonder if i need port hole in door lol they pound
POSITIVE	Good little set here. Lots of fun elements and good pose-ability. The lobster cant quite support itself on its little legs and the tips will frequently pop off (Easy enough to put back on). Paid fifteen bucks for this so its a great value; two minifigs, lots of uncommon pieces, even a couple printed pieces. I'll keep it out on display for a bit before taking it all apart and adding it to my collection.
NEGATIVE	Okay first of all... she cannot act.. second of all... why try singing? Just stop... please... and make us happy. she is too much of a goodygoody.. and she really pisses the hell outta me. Why would she go and make a greatest hits album when she hasnt even had one hit? urrghhh.. this item is not even worth talking about.
NEGATIVE	"Right out of the box...laser turned on, but you had to hold it in one spot for several seconds to get any kind of marking on the slate. 10 minutes later, the laser stopped working. Junk, junk, junk. The only reason I gave it one star is because I didn't have the option of giving negative stars. Again, I say, ""JUNK""!"
NEGATIVE	This Belkin 7-Port Hub is quirky --- sometines failing to recognize and/or handle certain devices. Since these same devices work fine with the Belkin 4-Port Hub, I'm rather disappointed.
POSITIVE	It does a good job for me - but I've only used it in the dry mode. Much better than my last electric razor.
NEGATIVE	I received season 5 of Dallas that I ordered from Amazon.com. I paid the new price, but received a used one from another company. Not only did it look bad from the package, it skipped all throughout the episodes. The last disc would not even play. The disc was so scratched up that the dvd player could not read it. Of course Amazon.com will not replace it, because they had someone else ship it. Amazon.com found this person selling it, but will not make it right with the defective product.
POSITIVE	I gave this a 4 as only two of my 4 kids like these. I think the consistency is a bit odd but my older girls think it's a great tasty treat.
NEGATIVE	Fred Durst has sunk to a new low. Unless you're a 13 year old who thinks breaking your curfew is cool and hate your parents for not buying you a Playstation 2, then you most likely won't want to buy this cd. Millionaire playboy Fred whines about his life like a four year old who just broke his little red fire truck, while the drums are only satisfactory at best and the guitar riffs are ready made for the MTV set. Recommended only if you are a thug wanna be.
POSITIVE	My son has had this book since he was 4 and he loves it. Not only is it a good way to learn about Chinese New Year, but it's cleverly designed -- the entire book folds out into a dragon float. We read it year round and he enjoys it for the story as much as for the fun of unfolding and folding it. A great book at a great price!
NEGATIVE	MTV&Mike judge have ruined Beavis&Butthead show by releasing this dvd, I think they should stop the process of making vol.2 and start seriously fixing this problem by producing the original B&B seasons dvd set.
NEGATIVE	Yes, you heard me. In the description it says that it is built to withstand 'rigorous' dog play. My 10 month old cattle-dog puppy (not a terrible chewer) had the thing ripped open in 30 minutes. 24 hours later she had removed all the stuffing (we were supervising her, of course) and the squeaker toy (which didn't even work in the first place. If you are looking for a dog toy that looks kind of cute that can 'withstand rigorous play'--look elsewhere, you will be very dissapointed with this toy and I presume others from this company. Two days later (right now) the insides are gone and the cover is shredded. Combat tested, it said on the package....now what exactly does that mean?
NEGATIVE	Its cheap for a reason!! This cable produced a barely viewable picture, with interference lines across the screen, and was a waste of money. Spend the extra, and get something worthwhile. Its a pointless purchase.
NEGATIVE	"Here is another set of straight-ahead jazz, just like they played it 40 years ago, from reactionary saxophonist Branford Marsalis. Yes, it's more challenging than Kenny G... but for anyone interested in truly innovative and ORIGINAL music, I would recommend checking out Dave Douglas, William Parker, Ken Vandermark, Steve Lacy or possibly even the ""self-indulgent bull****"" of Cecil Taylor."
NEGATIVE	The package was correct but the disk was volume one,we already have vol. one.Can I send it back and get the one we ordered.
POSITIVE	I purchased these for my wife and she loves them. When they arrived, I thought they were smaller than one carat each. I took them to my local jeweler and he confirmed they were each one carat. The black diamonds appear smaller than their one carat white counterparts. These are very attractively priced.
POSITIVE	Sarah Deane is at loose ends after completing her PhD. Bowdoin College doesn't have a place for her until the next semester, and Alex is incredibly busy at the hospital. Cousin Giddy's phone call seems like a godsend. At teacher at the exclusive boarding school at which she works is taking a maternity leave, and the school is in need of an English teacher immediately. Sarah accepts the position and is off to her childhood home of Carlisle, MA. The teachers are an odd bunch, but not sinister. Having been dragooned into going to a slide show given by the art history teacher, Sarah becomes one of the last people to see her alive.There are many plot twists and turns in this novel and the mystery is pretty engrossing. Borthwick writes an excellent academic mystery.
NEGATIVE	This was one of the worst purchase decisions I have ever made. The item is poorly constructed of inferior material. Dull on arrival and bi-level blade defies sharpening. Priced way too high for something that isn't worth the package it was shipped in. Do not bother - shop for an ulu or mezzaluna if you want quality.
NEGATIVE	didnt finish the book. not interested. a bit of a dry read. i dont belive in god so maybe that is why i dont like it
POSITIVE	I brought this camera to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro (19,200 ft) in sub-freezing tempertures. It took picutures beautifully and survived the difficult journey intact. Buy lithium batteries (per manufacturers recommendations) and you don't have to replace them as often.
POSITIVE	"I was very happy to find Dr. Schmidts book, ""SMART FATS"". Having spent several years researching EFA Balance, I found the information in his book to be very accurate and a wonderful information source. This country is in dire need for Omega Balance and for the knowledge to know why. Hurray for ""SMART FATS""!Stanley R. Mann, VP. Research and Education Integrity Direct Inc."
POSITIVE	"I was looking for a new book and took a chance on 'Reckless Homide'. I'm very glad I did. Ira Genberg will be as popular as Grisham if he keeps this up. I really enjoyed the trial. Ira did a great job explaining the legalese and what the characters were thinking. Isabel Castino and Diana Wells were great characters. I was surprised that the jurors didn't get more attention in the story. But it worked. I'm glad he didn't leave us hanging with: ""The up and down is stewed"". If you enjoy legal thrillers - you'll love this book. Ira, please give us more!"
NEGATIVE	It has been a month and a half since I ordered/paid for the product and I still have not received it. I emailed the seller three times............No response. I would not recommend this seller to anyone. Bad business!
POSITIVE	Luckily, the ring arrived just before we were leaving for our wedding ( we ordered it a little late :) ) However, it did not fit even though we used the site's ring sizer. We followed their directions to exchange it and are still waiting to receive the new ring.
POSITIVE	He wanted German chocolate for Christmas so I was happy to find these online. Will be buying these more often
NEGATIVE	I started viewing this movie because of the good recommendations, I was cheated. Supposedly an end of the world movie but I didn't see it in the parts that I watched. This movie goes from bad to worse and then gets even worse. What is this movie about? Is there a point? It made no sense to me, seems to me that it's an Angsty movie about teenage angst, with extra angst and more teenage angst thrown in just to make it more Angsty. I kept trying to find a good spot in this film or at least something that would indicate what was going on, never happened. Apparently the director was smoking 'pregnant guppies' while he was filming, because this movie makes no sense at all, and probably wouldn't get better (even if you smoked a 'pregnant guppy'). Just don't bother, watch a test pattern or snow on you TV instead.
NEGATIVE	I went out to place these on and found they don't fit the OE mirrors I have. They are for a 90 Dodge W-250 and do not work. Your better off to buy this at a local store to make sure it fits. They are worthless as they are to me.
NEGATIVE	This movie was SO coped of cars. It make me so so so so so SO MAD!!!!!!!!!!!! I really liked the movie cars and I was very MAD to see it coped like this. The whole movieis way to short. And no real plot just a bunch of cars TALKING. So exciting. Do not get this movie!!!! It's nothing but a ripoff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NEGATIVE	Rocks wear out the barrel in the middle, producing small holes which then leak the water and powder mix into the machine and all over the counter. If you are lucky, it will work once; the 2nd time, you have a mess halfway through the grinding/polishing process, with no way to finish, a worthless barrel and gears inside the machine that will grind themselves up.This was rec'd as a gift by my disappointed child. Note that it is sold under different brands, like EduScience (a ToysRUs label). Look CLOSELY at the barrel if you want to avoid this model; also, I think it is the only one with a clear plastic cover.
POSITIVE	As a cancer survivor, but on strong prevention drugs, I really needed this information of alternative health solutions.
NEGATIVE	I am aware of the difference between the Dept 56 reindeers which were produced prior to 2006 and the new Patience Brewsters reindeers which are being produced NOW. I specifically ordered these from you because you stated they were Dept 56 and I am trying to complete my set of DEPT 56 Krinkles Reindeers. Your advertising is very misleading and I was disappointed to receive the newly distributed reindeers. There are slight differences other than the boxes and I am trying to complete an ORIGINAL DEPT 56 COLLECTION...that is why I purchased these from you. I expect that you will correct this situation so that I don't have to contact Amazon and point out your misleading advertising...as there is a difference!!I look forward to a quick resolution.
POSITIVE	Mariah Carey is by far the BEST female solo artist in the industry...her 8 octave range cannot be compared with all the others...She is a legend and will always be one...Glitter is suprisingly entertaining considering i didn't expect much...Mariah proves that she can act, and look good while she is doing it...to all the mariah fans, GLITTER!!! ...
NEGATIVE	After reading the vague and extremely basic instructions, we tried to make our first batch. about half way through, the rollers jammed. Tried contacting the manufacturer only to be told the warranty doesn't cover this problem because they deemed it misuse. So I disassembled it and freed the rollers (due to poor machine work). Then the thickness adjustment knob failed. The thin metal used to make it actually tore. Don't bother with this one. Maybe others aren't so bad.
NEGATIVE	This book is full of statements about amazing proof of this or astonishing proof of that. It sounds like an article in a supermarket tabloid. The book mentions the hygiene laws amazing scientific revelations of God to Moses about the role microorganisms play in causing disease. The Bible nowhere mentions germs or microorganisms. It simply contains instructions about hygiene which contain merit but that in no way proves that Moses had been made aware of germs by God.END
NEGATIVE	I am a big fan of Harvest which is why I bought Peggy Sue. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. Apparently Tess tried out romance before she moved over to medical thrillers and this is a sad mix of Harlequin romance with just a little bit of thrill worked in the story. If you are looking for a book that is more romance than I would rec. reading this one. But if you are searching for a larger quantity of medical info & thrills...keep on searching. Tess is heading in the right direction (as seen in Harvest & Bloodstream) but needs to get past the mushy romance angle. Final thought: It's not her best work, but with paperbacks it's worth the price.
POSITIVE	Without fail, these recipes have been clear, concise (with drawings to help me make my gnocchi), and delicious. One caveat: when he tells you to use a non-stick pan...do it. My crunchy chicken curry dish was a disaster.
NEGATIVE	"I recently discovered The Shamen via Internet radio, and I was happy to find that one album that had so many of my new favorite songs - ""Ebeneezer Goode,"" ""Boss Drum,"" ""Phorever People,"" ""L.S.I.""... But after buying it, I sadly realized that it suffered from the classic ""album version"" syndrome. The versions I'd heard and fallen in love with were tighter and richer; the ones on this album tended to have boring extended intros and emptier, lighter mixes. I suddenly understood why this CD was out of print.However, ""The Shamen Collection"" was exactly what I was looking for. If you've heard The Shamen on the radio, on a dance compilation, or from P2P downloads, you probably heard what's on ""The Shamen Collection."" The Collection is a more expensive two-disc set, but it's defintely worth it. I know I won't be listening to ""Boss Drum"" again now that I own the Collection."
NEGATIVE	Low volume headset, Need an adapter to use with a cell phone. I ordered a different brand to see if I can get more volume. I will keep this set as a spare.
POSITIVE	I was very pleased with the price of the perfume and the quick shipment of my order. Great experience!
POSITIVE	This collection features the very best of Buddy Holly's career. The recordings have been digitally re-mastered and sound fresh and clean despite being recorded nearly 40 years ago. The bounce and fire for which Buddy's music is well known throughout the world is present, loud and clear. The actual tracks on the album are very likely the tracks Buddy himself would have chosen for a true representation of his music.An album to be recommended to both fans and people curious about one of the most important musicians in Rock 'n' Roll history. A highly recommended CD.
POSITIVE	"Jolie Holliday's album definitely leans toward the traditional side of country music, but is not excessively so. It is still very appealing to people, including me, who are more into modern country music. Jolie's voice is very good, capturing and conveying the emotion and attitude of each song. The songs themsleves are very good too, both music and lyrics. Especially pleasing are ""All the Good Ones are Gone"" and ""A Real Good Day"". The album came out in 2001, and there has not been another one from Jolie since. That's a pity, and is even more reason to be sure you get this one, especially if you like more traditional country."
POSITIVE	I liked the way it made my skin feel, tight and smooth, but I didn't really care for the smell. It seemed to be a little too much like wood. I would've liked it with a lighter smell.
POSITIVE	"Heartwarming romance with a hero and heroine who are good people-no courtesans or rakes here-just two decent people who've been hurt in the past and must learn to love and trust.The story starts in England, travels to America, spends a great deal onboard a ship, to finally end back in England. Mild bedroom scenes, a formulaic but interesting mystery, and lot's of familiar relationships abound.If you are a fan of ""nicer"" or Christian romances, but without the religious aspect, then you'll enjoy this book.4 stars."
POSITIVE	"After clicking for a long time, with my Canon 400D, my little finger used to get strained, as I have big hands.After getting the grip, not only does the grip make my hands ""full"", but it also looks like a 5D now :D :D"
NEGATIVE	True, I only bought this as an accessory for a Halloween outfit but it lasted for one showing. Pulled them out of the box and tried the key once and they broke. Waste of time. Get what u pay for.....
NEGATIVE	Most of his most popular music. I would be scared to go into an elevator or a dentist's office again.
POSITIVE	"After only hearing the track ""Human Beings"" I decided to dish out the cash to buy this CD. While waiting for it to arrive I read a review in NME saying it was a [bad] album. Needless to say my expectations dropped. When it arrived I popped it in my CD player and my jaw dropped. There are not a whole lot of albums out there that give me goose bumps, and this one did. Full of brilliant vocals, soaring guitar parts and well crafted songs, Under The Waves gets my approval and NME gets a kick in the nuts the next time I see them. Trust me you won't be dissappointed, and you can tell all your friends about this find!!"
NEGATIVE	I just bought this DVD along with two others; Leigh Ann's Advanced Pole Dance Workout and Sedusa Studios Advanced Pole Dancing. This one was by far the worst. The dancer is topless, pierced, and tattooed all over in a lot of the scenes, a man is narrating it, and it keeps skipping from advanced to beginning to advanced to intermediate. It's just not good. Leigh Ann's was must easier to follow and worth the extra cost.
NEGATIVE	my (now ex) girlfriend ordered this. i don't really know why. she got it shortly before she left me for a woman. perhaps the two things are related...
POSITIVE	This is a great grill and Amazon made it an incredibly easy process. Fast shipping (Eagle Freight) and 45 minutes to assemble. Piece of cake. Highly recommended.
NEGATIVE	I received the product very timely. There was one piece missing in the product and the instructions said to contact Merry Pet rather than return the product. Therefore I put the product together (minus the missing piece) and my cat seems to really like it. I like it too. The piece missing was a back panel which wasn't vital to the overall functionality of it was still missing. I have called them three times and no one answers. I always leave a message with my name, number and address. I have yet to receive a return call. Although I like the product I would probably never purchase anything from this company due to the missing part and their poor response to it. I could return it but it is more trouble than it is worth. Just live and learn.I'm sure the product is sold by other companies and I would suggest buying it from some other place.
NEGATIVE	"Everytime i see or read things about 50 cent i just have to laugh...Why? Because people actually think he's saying something that's never been said before...Another example of mainstream audiences (mtv/vh1 generations) being taken by the ""thug"" image that 50 cent TRIES SO HARD TO FAKE..THIS ALBUM ISN'T FOR THE STREETS,HOODS,OR THE GHETTOS..THIS IS FOR THE LISTENER WHO STAYS IN A UPPER CLASS NEIBORHOOD,KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT STREET LIFE AND WANTS TO FEEL LIKE ""A THUG"" SO THEY LISTEN TO IT TO FEEL LIKE THEY DISPLAY AND ""HARD"" PERSON..DON'T BUY THIS...A FALSE REPRESENTATION....AND I WANT EVEN GET INTO HOW HE TRIES TO SOUND LIKE TUPAC...-5 STARS"
NEGATIVE	I bought this with high expectations of finally having a good source for this fantastic anime series. But I'm very disappointed with the video quality: it shows dot-crawl and rainbowing everywhere. I was expecting the video to be resmastered and professionally cleaned, but all they did was some sharpening and color correction. All it was required to clean the dot-crawl and rainbowing was to recapture the LaserDisks and pass the image through a comb filter, as explained here:[...][...]Thus, being a basic problem with a well documented solution, the presence of those artifacts on this DVD-set image is a great disappointment.The audio quality, in the other hand, is very good, at least.
POSITIVE	Many people, as they age get numbness in their feet. The name for this is called Morton's Neuroma. I've found if you roll your feet on this device and take a couple tabs of potassium, it will help greatly.
POSITIVE	"The above title is from a quote in the booklet, ""in the north there are a lot of shadows. there are far more shadows than people. in the south the shadows are sharper and clearer. it is easier to talk to them. in the north, they dance sad waltzes with a sigh of rapture."" - per kirkeby. This describes better than I can the exquisite interleaving of the fiddle of Ola Backstrom, the nykelharpa (keyed fiddle) of Johan Hedin and the sax of Jonas Knutsson. Each of these musicians is a virtuoso on their instrument and together these tracks are hypnotic and soaring at the same time. One of my all time favorite albums. Has proved excellent car music also, traveling through the snow fields of Minnesota I arrive serene."
NEGATIVE	"I was somewhat hopeful after reading some of the other reviews that my 8 month Border Collie/Blue Heeler mix would finds days of enjoyment playing/chewing on this toy. Not the case, it was torned and chewed through in record time and put in the trash w/in less than 10 minutes. May be a great chew toy for older pups but for now I'll stick with the rawhide bones that I also get on Amazon "" Green Cow Rawhide Dog Bones, 6-7 Inch Natural Bones, 8-Count bags (Pack of 2)"""
NEGATIVE	"This was a book club assignment, I had not wanted to read this book because I had heard that there was some animal cruelty but as a member I try to appreciate other peoples book choices as they do mine.The cruelty was a little hard to read, especially the beatings of Rosie but I also found myself cringing at the unneccessary sex scenes that were over the top, boredom at the constant threat of tossing people of the train and disbelief at the stampede of the menagerie.I did like the elderly Jacob and his life at the nursing home, I think it shows how elderly people are often ""put on the shelf"" when they become a bother in life...so sad. Then this was spoilt by the idea that he ran away with the circus, was able to sell tickets even if he could not button his shirt and all with the acceptance of the current circus owner.I am sure the circus of that era was not a pleasant place but I think the characters could have been much better developed and the story a little less unbelievable."
NEGATIVE	"I may have received a ""lemon,"" but my experience with this chair so far is poor. Several pieces in the box were significantly damaged (large dents and deep, long scratches in the wood, one of the cushions was separating at the seams) and I spent 20 minutes on hold with the company to get replacement parts in ""maybe 15-30 days - if they have them""...As far as comfort, the chair is alright... Just remember - you get what you pay for. If you don't mind a chair that may arrive damaged, screws that don't line up correctly - basically a cheap product that was made in China, then this chair is for you. If you want something that is sturdy and built to last, I would look into higher end gliders made by another manufacturer (Dutalier, Best Chair, etc.)."
NEGATIVE	I purchased the phone tools in order to add my own ringtones and images to my phone, but only found out after installing it that Verizon customers are unable to use the multimedia functions. This is probably just so Verizon can make users pay for ringtones, etc. The program is decent, but almost completely useless to me without the multimedia functions.
NEGATIVE	DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER BUYING THIS PRODUCT.The only thing magic about this product is making you money disappear with no return on your investment other than frustration and another item to take out to the curb.Adjusting the size on this product is fraught with many pitfalls which will destroy the product.
POSITIVE	"I was expecting a video that addressed the ""Natural Golf"" method of playing golf because of the title of the video. This video DOES NOT do that. Also, Laura Davies is British, and it takes a while to get used to her accent.I gave it a 4 star since the video was well done and if you want a good video on how to play golf the regular way it is a good video."
NEGATIVE	I only got 5 songs i did not get all the songs that's suppose to come with the entire album
NEGATIVE	The print is too small! I ordered this book, sight unseen, for my elderly sister, who is the care-giver for her blind, Alzheimer-ish husband. Who would have thought that the publishers would have selected an inappropriate font size? Carol Clivio
POSITIVE	"This album makes me wish I were from a big family. Of course, not all large clans have the talent and connections that this group does: this is a really FUN album, featuring lots of great performances, not only by family members, but also by some of the top session musicians around, guys that have played with Chicago, the Stones, etc. As you would expect, the horn parts are great (very Chicago-esque), but so are the strings (especially the cello), and there's an amazing vocal duet by a couple of Michael's nieces who sound like a female version of Simon and Garfunkel. The thing I like best is that the there's a lot of variety in the production, the classics sound great, and the originals are nice too, like the excellent ""Christmas Time Without You"", and one which sounds like it could have been a newly discovered track from a ""Christmas with Elvis"" session. Pretty cool stuff."
NEGATIVE	There is no way you will ever get this gate open with a baby in your arms. It is aesthetically well designed and flows well in the house since it rolls up nicely. However, it is not practical for a high/moderate traffic area of the house. We have it covering a large opening from the kitchen and constantly end up with either the top or the bottom hook attached but rarely both.The problem with the install is not complexity but rather precision. I finally got the install right after 3 holes in the wall. It is tricky since you really have to accurately line up the hooks in order to get good tension on both the top and bottom. If you don't have a level and measuring tape you will end up with a few holes in the wall/door.
NEGATIVE	When no audio is playing, there is a horrible hum. Also falls off your head easily.Otherwise it is fine. Will not be using these for any longer
NEGATIVE	Zarley might be okay if you go in for the boy band sound. He came recommended with some great singers doing old standards and swing. That is not what this guy is about. A CD of needy love songs in a very contemporary format. His voice is nothing special and his style far from unique.
POSITIVE	I got this for my picky father. He's still using it after 5 years without a hitch. Solidly built small keyboard.
POSITIVE	"The SCTV crew did some of the best celebrity impressions, but my favorite here is the Bergman spoof ""Night Of The Wolf"". I find that some younger veiwers are not familiar with Dick Cavett and some of the other celebrities of that era. It is more fun if you are familiar with the person being impersonated. Everyone can enjoy the fictional cast that staffs SCTV in the episodes."
POSITIVE	"This could be considered a Permaculture approach to building your own house, covers almost everything you would need to know to replicate a similar, cost and ""eco"" effective housing, down to plumbing and plastering tutorials. This is by no means a comprehensive directory of all the available ""eco"" materials, but focuses on his thorough hands-on construction that is locally appropriate (Montana) like slip-form stonework and log-cabin, plus decent coverage of DIY masonry stove and a methane digester.Well written without too much narrative or technical analysis. Similar in value to Rob Roy's Earth-sheltered Houses"
POSITIVE	This excellent DVD is very well done, the story line holds youright there throughout the movie, plus plus for this DVD.A very good family DVD.
NEGATIVE	Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned.
POSITIVE	"I really do not see what everyone is bitching about- this album does not contain one bad song. Which is light years above what I can say for most albums I have heard, even the ""classics""; most albums have at least two or three skippers. I bought Urban Bohemia and could not stop listening to it for months, then bought Monkey House and that one is still on repeat in the player. I see no relation to ""lame 80's music"" and especially not Duran Duran whatsoever- they use keyboards, but in a completely original way that they make their own. This album makes me extremely happy and I am glad to have discovered the Dandies."
POSITIVE	Sidney Sheldon wrote a novel that is loads of fun to read. Don't miss this Sidney Sheldon novel. I couldn't put it down!!
POSITIVE	I am a very big fan of Alanis's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie album because it didnt get much airplay and it wasnt overplayed like many songs off of Jagged Little Pill. This album ranks higher than both of these...even the overplayed songs sound good. This CD is one of the best of all time in my opinion, I do wish she included some more songs off of Junkie, though. No Pressure Over Cappucino, Joining You, and Princes Familiar are by far the best songs on the album. The live versions of You Learn and That I Would Be Good are also good because they are stripped of their fake drum beats. I would reccommend this album to anyone who is a fan of acoustic music.
POSITIVE	Sandra Brown does not disappoint. I have no regrets when it comes to reading one of her suspense novels. I like the way she writes. This book was better than I expected because the liner notes were too brief and a bit misleading. I thought it more in the vein of Envy with a secret (the real truth about the shooting in the den), and a controversial act to catch the bad guy that makes you want to read a follow-up by Scott Turow. I like the way Sandra Brown gives you the story from several characters point of view, but I thought there were a few loose ends like the scorpions... Not as .... or crude as some of her novels, more romantic, which is better.
NEGATIVE	The writing is so bad that I returned the book. I am amazed that someone agreed to publish it. If you want to read a well-written, great analysis of liberals, get Ellsworth Baker's Man in the Trap.
POSITIVE	"As much as I love Nora Roberts, I can't give this re-release of PLAYING THE ODDS and TEMPTING FATE five stars. Why? For starters, as much as I wanted to I just couldn't get past the ""time warp"" problem. There is no way that couples who met, fell in love, and married during the 80s can have adult children in the 90s. I haven't read Daniel's story yet, but I'm sure I'll find it even weirder that by the time of THE MACGREGOR BRIDES, he's 91! Secondly, Caine's constant lighting up of cigarettes drove me crazy. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't French kiss anyone who smokes as much as he did in his story. Yuck! And lastly, if an author is going to write a family saga, she should remember what she's written in previous books. In Laura's story in BRIDES, Roberts alludes to Caine finally convincing Diana to take that walk down the aisle. Wrong! In Caine's story, Diana proposes marriage to Caine. Despite all that, the romances are wonderful. Roberts is one of the best."
POSITIVE	The VTech ip5850 was one of several cordless phones available that have the features I wanted, i.e. 5.8 GHz, digital answering system, two handsets with page and ability to transfer calls to other handset. I chose the VTech because itwas available at a great price, and I'm happy with another VTech cordless that we own. The ip5850 has performed well. It has excellent voice quality and good range. It's an attractive, solidly built unit, and I'll give it 5 stars if it proves to be durable over the long haul.
NEGATIVE	I must say, I was disappoined in this book. First, the short stories were too long and packed unpleasantly with unnecessary detail. Fancy wording took up too much space. Terminology was a bit 'off.' Isn't a Jedi one who has undergone training to become one? Also, if one wants to write a novel, write one, don't try to squeeze it doen to a short story.
NEGATIVE	I purchased this car holder for my z520a phone. The connector on the bottom of this car holder is completely inadequate for a car installation. A slight bump of the wire, or taking a turn too quick will cause the connector to come loose. The Sony Ericsson engineers should have known better.
POSITIVE	The colors in this comforter are beautiful. For FL it is a little heavy at night. I purchased the full/queen and attempted to wash it in my large capacity washer and it was way too bulky. You will have to take it to a laundry mat or dry cleaners if you want to wash it.
NEGATIVE	"Auditory integration training (AIT)is a scam that preys upon a parents desire to do everthing possible for their child. Google AIT and you will see there are no studies, only ""reports"" that validate AIT. The idea about ""training"" the middle ear muscles is entirely untrue on an anatomy and physiology standpoint. Why is there zero research out there valdiating a procedure that has been around for over 40 years? Before you spend a penny on AIT, make an appointment, that your insurance WILL cover, to talk to an Ear, Nose, and Throat physician or audiologist about it. AIT used to target individuals with autism and now that auditory processing disorders (APD) have been identified these individuals are now being targeted. It angers me that people are out there taking advanatage of these families."
NEGATIVE	"The battery life on Kodaks DX 3600 is very bad. I bought this camera and found out the hard way. After only 6 pictures, the battery icon started flashing ""low battery"" The camera only comes with one battery pack of 2 batteries. If you want to take more than a dozen pictures, you had better have lots of charged extra batteries. My camera refused to turn on after 12 pictures. I had batteries from another Kodak camera (DC265)and those would only last 2-3 pictures and then go out. When talking to tech, he said the old ""145 Ni-MH"" were not good and I needed the newer ""165 MiMH"" which came with the camera. I am going to send the camera back."
NEGATIVE	I like Ralphie May , but I don't think this was one of his best, I have seen much better then this..I was not too happy with this
POSITIVE	Story of College friends who hapeen to be gay. One is stuggeling with his sexuality but when it mattered he finaly stepped up and came out. The other heterosexual friend who was very cool with his frineds sexuality added to the feel good theme of this movie. Remember it is a movie however, too bad real life can't be like this most of the time.
NEGATIVE	The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick explores some of this fascinating man's life and works, but ultimately fails at being an interesting movie. The interviews are okay, but there's nothing here that can't be found elsewhere where you can learn more. The often repetitious animation of PKD mouthing his actual dialogue gets to be grating and the audio isn't very clear either. An old fan of PKD will be bored watching this, a new fan might get interested enough to pursue other biographies and want to read more of his works.
POSITIVE	"for a long time, there wasn't a lot of asia video out there. then came some bootlegs, then the music videos and concerts in russia and europe. finally....a concert that spans the entire musical careers of all the members!!! it is so nice to see and hear songs from yes, king crimson, elp, and even...the buggles. for me, the highlight was asia doing a monster version of ""fanfare for the common man"". the band truly seemed to enjoy the variety of material, as well as all the classic asia songs. would have liked to see ""go"" played, but that is covered in other collections. i like steve howe, but pat thrall actually did a nice job in his asia stint. palmer is palmer....the king! downes is a creative force, and wetton has been one of my favorite vocalists since the 70's. asia fans....this is a MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
POSITIVE	"I've been a ""Wheel of Time"" rider for four years but when a friend loaned me a copy of ""Wizard's First Rule"" I knew I had found a new author. ""Stone of Tears is the best sequel to the beginning of a saga that I've ever read. In fact it's the best book I've ever read! It mixes magic with intrigue, suspense with detail, everything that was always impossible to put together has been. Goodbye Jordan hello Goodkind"
NEGATIVE	Very outdated and boring to sit through. Looks to be early 70's style and gives very dry blah narrative. Almost no actual scenes from the train.
POSITIVE	Very thought provoking, suspenseful, and adventurous! With endearing characters. The writers accomplish the task of balancing action with drama so that it appeals to a variety of audiences.
POSITIVE	I've used my Sony HVR-Z1U HDV camcorder in some very extreme conditions, and it it comes through on a regular basis. I shot Hurricane Katrina video footage during the storm (for StormStock) in driving 100 mph rain. At that time, I had purchased and was using a rain coat for the camera. It never failed. Previously, in Hurricane Dennis, the unit failed in the rain, without the coat. The screen went black. I dried it off with a hand dryer and it came back to life to be called back into action with Katrina.My HVR-Z1U has shot hurricane video, tornadoes, lightning, and other storm footage, often in the rain and dust. And, it keeps on going.The unit prefers mid-range lighting. It can shoot good footage if you give it that.Sony can improve this unit by adding SDI to output to HDCAM. I'd also like to see true 24P added and maybe variable frame rates.This camera is just a couple options away from being a professional system.Martin LisiusPrairie Pictures, Inc.
POSITIVE	Very light saw. Good power to weight ratio. I don't have a tablesaw, but this saw is doing its' work in the mean time.
NEGATIVE	I bought this and installed the hardware/software. Then PC freezes up after use of scanner for 30 seconds or so. Sometimes it freezes even without using scanner. Tried latest driver on their web, no help. Turns out they have driver to solve freeze problem for some other version of their scanners, but not for this. Promptly returned.I am disturbed by the current practice of software/hardware industry for shipping a product without thorough QA. I am extremely happy with the current practice of electronic dealers for letting buyers refund their money without much probing.Do not recommend if you have NT 4.0 (even though the box says it is supported). I have Service Pack 6 and SQL Server 7 installed, not sure if that's the reason. No time to find out.Bryan
POSITIVE	This DVD was amazing to watch after Episodes 1 and 2's disappointments. It focuses on the lesser known battles of the Clone Wars and is fun to watch for anyone. I first assumed that it'd be a bad idea to use brand new actors for everyone's voices except for C3P0 but I was wrong. All voice actors sound 100% authentic. A must buy.
NEGATIVE	I am not too happy with this, the cookies are supposed to be covered in white powder, the powder is now brown, you have to buy in a large quantity and I can't send back the item after I saw and was not happy with it.
NEGATIVE	"UNIT WAS OK WHEN IT WORKED --ABOUT TWO MONTHS. RETURNED UNDER WARRANTY. I PAID TO SEND IT TO COBY AND THEY CHARGE $18 FOR RETURN POSTAGE. NO PROBLEM UNTIL..... THEY SENT A LESSER MODEL 7050 - WOULD NOT SEND EQUAL MODEL UNLESS I PAID TO RETURN IT. I MENTIONED THAT WARRANTY REPLACEMENT SHOULD EQUAL OR GREATER VALUE (WOULD YOU WANT A 25"" TV IF YOUR 46' WAS SENT IN FOR REPAIR) THEY STATED THAT THIS IS THIER POLICY. COBY PRODUCTS ARE CHEAP YES. THEY ARE ALSO JUNK AND THE COMPANY SUCKS .. SONY IS SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER IN TERMS OF QUALITY AND SERVICE"
NEGATIVE	"Mine plays OK, but I hear ""click"" continuesly - multiple times in a second. It seems to me this comes from the rotors/wheels. Also the product is different than pcitures - wire is straight , not coil type."
NEGATIVE	I bought this product because I was looking for a low-cost solution to some data-loss issues. I found that it is pretty effective at retrieving many deleted files, and does a better job than many other low-cost or free programs of this type. It even allows you to preview the files before restoring them. However, I am quite disappointed by the fact that the program cannot restore the original file and folder structures, or even the original names of the files themselves, which can create a great deal of confusion when it comes to sorting the restored files. Therefore, if these issues are of concern to you, I would recommend spending a bit more if necessary to buy software that provides these features.
POSITIVE	In setting up a Home Office, I sought an easy means to switch between a WinXP box and Apple System. This gave me that and more. I highly recommend the unit for anyone attempting to cut down on wire clutter and empower themselves with a one-click method for switching in between systems and operating systems.
NEGATIVE	What a waste of time and energy this film is for Colin Firth. He is an incredibly talented and intelligent actor and I fail to understand why he would stoop this low to have agreed to act in this immensely stupid film? Uma Thurman not only can't do comedy, she needs to quit acting altogether. This woman can't act and it shows. The best part of the whole film is the Bollywood dancing segment which does not fit into the whole scheme of the film by the way. I had to fast forward my way through the movie because it was painful to watch. Please save your money and don't even rent it. Just forget it was ever made.
POSITIVE	"Mark B. Ledenbach's new book ""Vintage Halloween Collectibles""is an exhaustively comprehensive reference guide for all collectors of Halloween. It is also a valuable resource for dealers who would like a better understanding of value and rarity for their own selling standards. Inside you will find an extensive catalog of vintage Halloween items beautifully photographed with each item carefully identified by maker, country of origin, year made, dimensions, level of rarity and current value. The book covers a huge range of decorations, noise makers, diecuts, candy containers, nodders, figurals, lanterns and shades, games and more! If you've been a long time collector of Halloween or are just beginning, you will find this book an invaluable tool--not to mention it's just plain fun to browse through!"
POSITIVE	I never saw the thrill of 'Run Lola Run.' To me, it was trying a little too hard to be hip, and not really succeeding.'Princess and the Warrior,' however, is a different story. Both visually breathtaking and thought provoking, the film brings up questions about love, death, and destiny. Franka Potente is absolutely stunning in her role as a sheltered nurse who pursues the man who saved her life . . . and who appears in her dreams.Many people are reluctant to watch a foreign film, uneasy with having to read and watch at the same time. Yet when the foreign film is excellent, something magical happens. You forget that you're reading at all.'Princess and Warrior' is one of those films.
POSITIVE	I am glad the old thrash sound has been reformed ! This as with some other newer bands out are some great thrash albums . So if your into old Exodus , Anthrax and that style 80's thrash you'll love this !
POSITIVE	This book held my attention all the way through.Historical facts were mixed with exciting adventures and humour. The sheer bravery of the author was, at times, totally amazing.As this is also an expose of Burma's modern tragedy,just writing this story was a brave thing to do.He has an extraordinary ability to take the reader with him as he goes through various trials and tribulations and to make history come alive again. An excellent book from this Scottish writer.
NEGATIVE	"I'm beginning to get the feeling that some women authors are forgetting the main focal point of a romance novel--the romance. Somebody please remind Diana Palmer, because her latest book, ""Love With a Long, Tall Texan"" reads more like a perspective on the cattle industry and their practices, than a romance. The only consistency is that the second and third stories are more boring than the first. When people start writing books just to pick up a paycheck--IT SHOWS!"
NEGATIVE	My little one got this toy for Christmas, I purchased it at toys r us. When we put it together we found it came missing a leg, I have called the manufacturer for the leg 3 times and they simply arent standing by the product because I havent recieved the leg which makes it useless!I cant locate the receipt to bring it back to the store and get my money back, and they dont have any more to replace it. So we are stuck with a usless vanity.Thank you!
POSITIVE	this work is dense and complex; I'm still hopeful the reward will be commenserate.
POSITIVE	My son got accepted to the High School of Engineering and Science. So this is a must have for the next four years. I decided on the SE version over the standard as it has a faster processor (which is not a deal breaker) but the additional memory for storage is what makes this a better buy over the standard.
POSITIVE	This is yet one of the greatest cd's ever made in the history of music. Usually most cd's have a few bad songs but this one doesn't. Buy this one so you don't miss out on it.
POSITIVE	"THIS IS SIMPLY THE BEST CLINICAL CHEMISTRY TEXTBOOK AVAILABLE TODAY. IT HAS THE GREAT ADVANTAGE THAT IT FOCUSES ON THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES THAT EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN THE CLINICAL AREA NEEDS TO KNOW, AND ALSO CORRELATE THIS PRINCIPLES WITH THE ANALYTICAL METHODS, CLEARLY EXPLANING ALL THE ""CLASSICAL METHODS"", AS WELL AS THE NEWEST METHODS (SUCH AS HPLC, CHROMATOGRAPHIC METHODS) AND THE ""CLASSICAL"" ONES (SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC, COLORIMETRIC), AND THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES IN USING ONE OR ANOTHER. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY A CLINICAL CHEMISTRY TEXTBOOK, BUY THIS ONE."
NEGATIVE	The description of this collection is deceptive.There is no active table of contents.This makes finding individual stories difficult.
POSITIVE	This is perhaps one of my favorite Asian exports. The second session has such strong episodes, outlining things to come and bringing depth to some of the side characters. I think that the best part of a story is giving you things to relate to and these storys are full of that.With plot twists, foreshadowing, and a new character, you can't go wrong. Pick up the fist session and continue with this one. You won't be sorry you did.
NEGATIVE	it didn't start ... I tried normal and HD version.....sorry! hope you didn't charge my account! regards chiaranever had problem before this! let me know
NEGATIVE	This has been my makeup for 20 years and has been discontinued. The product received had small lumps throughout and an odd smell. I'm unable to use this makeup.
POSITIVE	This one here, has to grow on you. when you listen to it, it does sound like a 3 stars album but actually a 4, so there you have it.
NEGATIVE	In the beginning I loved my shark. It picked up all the crumbs my kids made and lots of cat and dog fur. I used it at least twice a day. After a month of raving about how wonderful it was, the handle broke off. I tried to get a replacement but the part was unavailable. Figuring I just had a case of bad luck, I bought another one. This time I bought the one with the additional side brush. The side brush was certainly not worth the additional ten dollars as it didn't do any better job than the original one without it. After a month and a half of use the handle broke off (in the same place) on the second shark. Great concept but I cannot afford the monthly replacement costs. I guess it wasn't bad luck but poor quality.
POSITIVE	if you love telenovelas you must buy this one.it has everything suspense,love,hate,not to mention the chemistry between the actors.the only bad thing is the music,but after some time you get use to it.they cut a lot of scenes.but this soap opera has 100 episodes,so they cant fit it into 2 dvds.all the good parts are in.
POSITIVE	Just one thing to make note of: this book does NOT cover the whole series. It covers seasons 1-8 only, but NOT seasons 9-10, Stargate SG-1:Continuum, and Stargate SG-1: The Ark Of Truth.
NEGATIVE	Beware -- if you buy the Video on Demand version available for download, you don't get the Spectre short. They ought to say that in the description, because it is billed as just another available format of the same product as the DVD.
NEGATIVE	The main character Carlos Castillo is an egotistical, arrogant jerk. His cohorts are portrayed as little more than sychophantic lapdogs. And somewhere in the book is hidden a plot. But it takes hours and hundreds of pages to figure out it's a plot not worth reading. Unbelievably bad writing. How does this author get away with writing such drivel?
NEGATIVE	"The content is good, but I don't recommend you buy it. This book has been released in the public domain so you can download it for free. In addition, as mentioned in other people's comments, you may want to consider ""Ideas and Opinions"", which is a much more comprehensive collection."
POSITIVE	I had this album stolen from my car and decided to buy it after many years it was like I was in college pooseling chicks again. Viva puntang!
NEGATIVE	i'm sorry but this really is sad,a 60's jam ethic here puts me to sleep.ritchie sounds great as always,so that alone deserves it two star rating from me.cozy's drumming has always been overrated,too clumsy styled,he's considered a great,but it falls on my deaf ears why he is,he's got only a tenth of the talent that bonham,ward or paice possesed.pass!
NEGATIVE	"The protagonist of this book mentions a Latin quote: ""No old man forgets where he has hidden his treasure"" Well....in this case it seems that Marquez has forgotten exactly that: the place where he has hidden his superb skills as a narrator of fascinating, magic realistic stories.The novel is a shallow, disappointing story about a 90 years old bachelor and his love for a teenage virgin he likes to watch while she sleeps. The magic atmosphere of the small South American city which is Marquez forte in other novels feels like a strained recycled background to an unsatisfying story.Is it possible that like Salvador Dali at old age allowing young painters to imitate his style, this book was written by a ghost writer while the old master nods his head slowly in the heat of an afternoon siesta in Macombo ?"
NEGATIVE	Painful to read...no glory, no A-Ha Moment. Shlock. I am not a quitter. I finished it. Wish I hadn't picked it up...I trusted Oprah's pick; that was a LONG TIME ago: lesson learned.
POSITIVE	In the beginning of the book you will find yourself laughing out loud by reading the truth, nothing but the crude truth splattered right there on your face!A little too deep into the vegetarian population makes you think twice when you are to take a bite at that delicious BBQ of yours, and really you will have a different way of thinking eating habits.A great reading full of information well written indeed, you will not be able to put the book down for a minute and will want to finish it all at once!Ciao and have fun skinny bitch!
POSITIVE	I really like Bones Sixth Season- So many new things are happening and it makes it very exciting. I always wonder what will happen next. I recommend it to all Bones lovers.Marie
NEGATIVE	"I know the title said ""mini"" but I couldn't believe how small it actually was when I got it. It barely makes any noise at all unless you blow into it full force, and the noise it does make is high-pitched, annoying, and sounds nothing like a train. I was highly disappointed and would not recommend this toy."
NEGATIVE	They built the main support beam and fastening joint with cheap plastic. Broke literally the first time I used it. Am sending it back.
NEGATIVE	Does he play Beethoven at all? If you like Beethoven piano concerto, please listen to Backhaus, Schnabel, Fischer or Perahia!
NEGATIVE	WHAT GIVES ME MORE ANGRY OF THIS MOVIE ISN'T THAT ITS AN AUTHENTIC MANURE FESTIVAL, BUT RATHER FOR BLAME OF HER IT WILL NO LONGER BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE A DECENT SEQUEL OF CREEPSHOW WITH THE BUDGET AND SOME WORTHY HISTORIES LIKE THE FIRST TWO. THE BUDGET FOR THIS MOVIE MAYBE WAS 3 DOLLARS MOSTLY, 2 FOR ALL THAT JELLO THAT IMITATED DECAY HUMAN MEAT AND KOOL AID FOR THE BLOOD. THE ACTORS, I COULD BET THAT THEY WORKED FOR FREE IN THIS.
POSITIVE	"This was a very good read. Like many of Anne Tyler's other books the plot is well thought out, but with twists enough to keep us reading. I really became involved with the characters and found them to be so real sounding. I found traits in them that are in people I know. Ian and dealing with his guilt and grief will stay with me for a long time. I think we all, at times in our lives, have that desire to know what we can do to make atonement for the wrong(s) we've done in our lives. Did Ian find that? A great book, and a definate good look at guilt, religion, and what saves. But not just for the ""religious"" out there."
POSITIVE	I thought this would be a movie that I would have little intrest in, how wrong I was. I was hooked 15 minutes into and could not stop watching.
POSITIVE	All I can say is that this is one of my favorite CDs and one of the best CDs I've ever listened to. And, Deftones rock live too. They are the most talented band from Sacramento in my opinion. All the songs on the CD are great, and you have to appreciate the sheer emotion Chino and the guys bring to their thrash/metal style, which is invividual from other bands. Bottom line: if you are considerening getting this CD, buy it or else you'll miss out on some awesome music. Headup with Max Cavalera and Around the Fur are my favorites, but all the songs rock.
POSITIVE	This is basically background music for sex. Excellently produced and mixed, E-Smoove never loses sight of the album's direction, ie. sexual arousal. Heavy bass, juicy, persistent tribal rhythms, some live sex thrown in; what more do you want? Like he says on one of the tracks, it is 'highly contagious.'
NEGATIVE	I agree with some of the other negative reviews. I've used the Revlon dryer styler round brush for years. When they die, I replace them. The former one didn't last as long as the others and this new one has designed those openings to keep it from overheating. Well, not only does it vent very hot air, it blows the surrounding hair in all directions, undoing what you just did. I came online to try to track down an older model.
POSITIVE	This book explained everything on the test in detail and was easy to understand. I recommend getting the Cliff's Test Prep too because of the practice tests (this one did not have any but was definetly worth the money). Passed the test my first try.
POSITIVE	Life is Beautiful is a wonderful, moving, TRUE story of one's families experience in WWII Europe and eventually the horrors of the Holocaust. I never believed I would be able to find humor in a movie depicting the Nazi war machine and its attempt to elimate European Jewry from the face of the earth. What Benigni does is simply amazing. He makes everyone laugh at his antics while feeling incredibly sad only a few moments later. This journey of emotions is something you rarely find in films these days. I applaud Benigni et al and suggest that everyone buy this movie and watch it over and over again.
NEGATIVE	Hi! I did not read this book yet but my close friend Brandy said that THIS BOOK IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ!I have a baby now who is 6 months old and the method described in this book looks very interesting. Also, sounds like a hilarious read with some good facts about understanding your body. Nothing like a book with some good humor in it.PS- Brandy is pregnant!
NEGATIVE	1. Cheap2. OK for protecting lens when no bright light source in front3. Causes ghosting with bright light source (not multi coated)
NEGATIVE	The Instructions were unintelligible. I have an IQ of 120 and and an MS in Elec Engineering, and had to take it back and exchange for a better one,
NEGATIVE	DO NOT, under any circumstances buy this RAM.PC133 SDRAM. How basic can you get? According to the specifications, it should have had no trouble working in our computer. Well this stuff is junk. Had to put the old RAM back in to get the machine to boot up, and now off to find something reliable.
POSITIVE	I purchased this book from Amazon.com because I have met the author...I only knew that the book had suspense in it. I had no preconceived notions of the book and did not know what to expect.Little did I know that once I started reading, I would have difficulty putting it down. I found myself looking forward during the day to the evening, when I could devote time to reading.The novel is very well written, the characters and plot excellent. A highly recommended read!
POSITIVE	This is one of the great movies of recent time. Add to it all the deleted scenes on this great DVD and this is a classic that any Kevin Smith fan needs to have.Without a doubt a needed addition to any DVD collection.
POSITIVE	Superman dying.Lex Luthor on death row.The sun at risk.Superman revealing things to Lois Lane and spending time alone with her.I'm glad I watched it.
NEGATIVE	Ok wow this is one of those where it is hard to even start on. The acting in this movie is just painful to even watch. The story is almost as if a 10 year old was telling it. I mean this is worse than most made for TV movies. Don't bother buying this. Buy another blu-ray disc... Pick any other blu-ray movie and you will be better off than with this one.
POSITIVE	I really really liked it. The characters were great and the story was great. I am really glad they combined the two books. It was so entertaining and diverting.
NEGATIVE	Instead of improving on a great formula, EA decided to go in a whole new direction by making the latest Need For Speed politically correct. Gone are the races through the city streets and the chases by the police. Instead, what EA has given us is an uninspired track racing game with a racing announcer whose voice and repetitiveness begins to grate on one's nerve like fingernails on a chalkboard. I found myself bored after only an hour of play and eventually lost all interest in playing this game.Everyone makes mistakes, and EA is no exception. Hopefully they will return to what works and the next Need For Speed installment will make us all forget about the nightmare known as Need For Speed Pro Street.
POSITIVE	"I wanted to get the ""Wave"" model of the Leatherman tool based upon a recommendation from a family member. After discovering that there is a black version, I chose this one and my wife got it for me at Christmas. The tool does leave black residue on your hands for some time (reminds me of my youth when I handled coal) :O) I have a number of low-end multi-tools, but the Leatherman is much better quality, especially the edge on the knife blades.I believe this will be a durable, life-time tool for me."
POSITIVE	I am very happy with not just the games performance, but the great service that came with it.I've first played this game when I was 8, and I am glad that I can relive this experience.THANKYOU!
NEGATIVE	Perfect... if you've been living under a rock. Extremely disappointing, basic and just plain boring. I runed it twice because I could not believe that was it, I though maybe my DVD had skipped or something.I though it would give information on tableware and how to use it: none.I though it would show beautiful table settings: none -except for a shot of a pinecone place card holder...dah!As for working with a caterer, she actually refers you, in all seriousness, to the phone book!I'M SO UPSET I SPENT ACTUAL $$ ON THIS!
NEGATIVE	I've never read Karen Harper before and when I saw the summary ofthis one I thought it looked good. I was wrong. There is waytoo much dialogue in some scenes of this book and the charactersdon't show a lot of emotion. This book has a few parts that weremysterious, the rest seemed dull and drawn out. I was happy that the author didn't include profanity or any brutal violence, but instead of a classic thriller she ended up writing a predictable story. I hope her other books are better.
POSITIVE	As Mr. Huddleston said, this is a truly unique collection of progressive rock songs from the top artists of the genre in the 70's. I have been looking for this for quite a while, and of course, find it in the most obvious place! Great stuff
POSITIVE	Michael Ball is relatively new on my list of preferred vocalists. I first discovered him a couple of years ago on a PBS broadcast of the Les Miserables 10th year anniversary production. Since then, I have been trying to build my CD collection of his music. This is my third album by Michael and by far the best. I concur with some comments that I have seen noting that he has sometimes not had the right collection of material to do justice to his incredible voice. This album does! When I received it the other day, I put it in my car CD player and as I drove down the freeway, kept saying YES! Yes! Finally he has material that does his incredible voice proud. If you are not sure which of his albums to start with, I strongly suggest this one. It is quite incredible.
POSITIVE	I have learned a lot about the fundamentals of chess so far, and it's great to have so many different game types...it's makes for an interesting way to develop chess skills when you have no human opponent.
POSITIVE	I compared the roc n soc and DW thrones with backrest side by side... The roc n soc was much more comfortable
NEGATIVE	I'm not to happy with this buy the one track on the radio is good however the rest of the album does not have great tracks usually the case when you buy a CD like this one hit wonder still have to inpress me not a must to buy.
POSITIVE	By far the worst acted, cheesiest, most stilted piece of celluloid toilet paper I've ever seen. A true alien race would erase mankind in a nanosecond if it ever watched this movie.And it was great! So bad in every way it's howlingly funny, with Criswell's solemn inanities bookending the movie. I saw a public screening of the show with a comedy improv group providing additional dialogue throughout. This movie should be on everyone's must-see list of the classics.
POSITIVE	We bought 2 of these fans for our patio. They are beautiful and work great. The only disappointment, the sail cloth appeared white in the pictures but is really more of a cream and it's a silky material, not canvas. Neither issue was cause to send them back, they look great up and really move the air!
NEGATIVE	I heard great things about this product which I still continue to believe. But I also heard a recommendation to put it into your protein shake, NO! Horrible idea! This stuff tastes DISGUSTING in anything! I believe it's healthy, but I have to take it like a shot with a tablespoon like medication.
POSITIVE	Purchased this for my grandson's first communion. It is a nice cross for a little boy.
NEGATIVE	"Track 12 is ""So Blase"". Should have been the title track to this album. The only song that Ms. Addlington does any justice to is the new track ""Don't Talk"". Very disappointing. Go get Annie Haslam's solo albums - you'll enjoy ALL of them. Not this one."
POSITIVE	"Why did Disney wait so long? Our son has loved this movie since it was first shown during Halloween,1997. Every few months or so, we would look on Amazon.com to see if it was available for sale. We taped it years ago but the quality of the tape is poor and it is worn out so I was so happy to finally see it available on DVD at Amazon.com and ordered it immediately. The acting by the kids isn't so great, but the story is fun and the theme music is memorable. Bill Fagerbake is great as the mummy. Our son just loves the fact that he is in this film and is also ""Patrick"" from ""Sponge Bob Square Pants"" and one of the Criterion Brothers in one of our other favorite movies, ""Funny Farm"". This movie is heart warming and fun. It didn't win any awards, but it is an enjoyable Halloween film that can be watched anytime during the year. Thanks Disney and Amazon.com!"
NEGATIVE	"When I first started listening to MMW, I loved the music that was in the groove. I listen to this album and all I hear is a groove without any music. In this album the set up the same undulating grooves that they have in their past albums, but they don't go anywhere with them. John Medeski is one of the most talented pianist I have ever heard, yet any mediocre keyboardist could play most of the stuff on this album. I'll admit that I'm being a little harsh when I only give them one star, but when I know what this excellent band is capable of, they deserve no more. If you want to hear a real album, listen to thier new album ""Tonic"". It will blow you away."
POSITIVE	This book has Swamp Thing in outer space for a fair part of it, as he encounters various other dc figures in his travels, such as those from the planet Rann, and the odd Green Lantern, and even the New Gods.He does eventually end up back on Earth, and is a little peeved with some of the bad guys.As The Shadow would say, if Swamp Thing is after you, 'The weeds of crime bear bitter fruit.'
POSITIVE	This book is easy to follow all concepts. Any new power system engineers should have it in order to understanding a deregulated market.
POSITIVE	Well, I had the chance to fly the Beta version of FS 2002. The best part of it was finaly the WX was very realistic. I put the WX to THSA with with heavy precip. When I did a side view, it looked very real, I thought I was in the BE-99 that I fly in real life. Shooting an app down to mins was like the real thing. I was truly impressed. I found that the airport listing was much better than before& when you wanted to find an airport, you could just use the airport idenifier ie. KBUR KLAX ect. and it took you there. The hold short and taxi lines were a big pluss. The ATC was ok, But I am andvit VATSIM user. I tryed to load up Squawk Box, and it just did not like it at all.I hope it will work when it if finally released.The bad thing was, I did not see ant improvement of the frame rates in flight. And like I said before SQ Box did not work with it. I am sure some good person out there will get it to work for everyone. Excellent job as usal Microsoft :)Cpt. Michael D MaxhamAmeriflight
POSITIVE	Save yourself the shipping and order several at a time. This book reminded me of my mother, so I bought one for her for Mother's Day, and she then gave it to my grandmother, and then bought copies for my aunt and her daughter, and now my sister in Baltimore has gotten one. We're starting our own Jackie Style book/fashion club. What's so wonderful about this book is that you start just looking at the pictures, and then you're drawn into her story, the history, her courage, her grace. It is inspiring. Well done Keogh!
NEGATIVE	"Unfortunately, the title of this book continues the myth aboutthe true meaning of one of Einstein's most famous quotes, that""God does not play dice with the universe.&quot. Though the book was good in its dealings with the scientific matters at hand, its attempt to use it to somehow validate or push a theological agenda is discomforting. END"
NEGATIVE	I have owned this dictionary for about 18 months. Used it once in a while, however, its screen started to show signs of failure not a long time ago. The Ectaco refuses to repair (I was told that they, actually, do not repair its products at all, they just replace them), and asks ~$200 to exchange it for another model which will probably last another two years... I have two Ectaco electronic dictionaries, and based on my experience, all of their products are overpriced. Their Customer Service is far from being perfect.
NEGATIVE	If you're new to Pat Metheny, Bright Size Life is NOT the one you want to buy. I think it's his first work, and it basically sounds like any Jazz trio you may find in a college ensemble. CD's like Letter From Home (my favorite), Offramp, Secret Story, First Circle, and Still Life Talking have the outstanding and unique sound that made Pat a superstar.There was not even 1 song on this CD that I could add to my Metheny MP3 collection. Not even close. I wasted my money. I usually only do positive reviews on Amazon, but I got so tired of seeing Bright Size Life so high up in the Pat Metheny sales rankings that I just wanted to warn people.
NEGATIVE	SORRY PEOPLE BUT LET ME SPEAK MY MIND. DISS ALBUM IS GARBAGE YO MANNIE FRESH RUNNIN OUTTA BEATZ BECAUSE DATZ WHAT PEOPLE LOOK 4 DESE DAYZ IS JUST BEATZ. I MEAN DA LYRICS CAN BE WACK BUT DA BEATZ CAN BE HOT. I HOPE WHEN BIG TYMERS ALBUM COME OUT IT WON'T BE LIKE DISS GARBAGE ALBUM. I GUESS IF I LISTEN 2 IT SOMETIMES IT CAN BE ALRIGHT. ALL OF THE SONG ON HERE ARE SLOW AND SLUGGISH. SWIZZ BEATZ $ D.J. PAUL CAN MIX BETTA DEN MANNIE FRESH.
POSITIVE	"3/4"" Hose End Battery Operated Timer (5.2 GPM)Dig Corp.This product is very versitale, and reliable. Be sure to check the battery from time to time. This is easily done using the indicator on the timer.It allows me to water remote areas of our property."
NEGATIVE	The Ballast has blown out for this lamp with a loud Buzzzztttt. It does not look simple to replace nor should it have to be replaced after only 9 months of use. As this lamp is inexpensive, and I do not have the original packing materials, I am just going to throw this out and buy a better built lamp for my home office. I believe it would be much more trouble tr try to get it fixed than it's worth.
POSITIVE	This was great for the money, but it is a little loud. I know use this for only going 5-20 blocks and got a full face for my 45min commute.
NEGATIVE	I am sorry, but I have read this premise time and again. A mail order bride from the Coast of Maine arrives in Texas to find that the Ranger who supposedly placed the ad, in reality did not. He is wounded in a Comanche raid. She ends up taking care of him and his son who was stolen by the Comanche but is rescued and brought home. Only Kate and the cook seem to be able to handle this 8 year old. But love wins out!This is a first read of Landis' writing. I would have enjoyed more historical material. Altho it was a cozy romance, I cannot see giving it a 4 and 5 star review. But then, I just finished a Diana Gabaldon novel and Summer Moon pales by comparison.Hey! I cannot write a fluffy novel like this and get it published!
POSITIVE	This is a tea ball. You put tea in it, and put it in your cup, and then you have tea.
POSITIVE	Aparently in the days of the depression, California was still sort of a wild west with a lot of areas having people who really didn't know how to live in this new environment. Additionally modern machines and automobiles were aparently daunting when it came to creating new safety issues. In response to this the California governement made these movies to teach people how to live in modern california. It seems silly today that t hey had to teach people how to drive on the road or how to avoid heatstroke but aparently this was needed. I liked the overall historical perspective and it made me realize how far we have come in a couple generations.
NEGATIVE	"If there's one word that I can use to describe this long-in-waiting film by master filmmaker Martin Scorsese, it is ""disappointing"".the biggest problem wasn't its runtime as much as it was the story, which felt like it was trying to appease too many agendas at the same time, and ended up not truly fulfilling any of them. Is this film about gangs in New York? Sort of...but not entirely. Is this movie about a love affair between an angry young man and a cute pick-pocket? Sort of...but not entirely. Is it about revenge, is it about the history of New York during the late 1800s? Sort of. Lots of stuff is kind of covered in this movie, but none of it goes into much detail,If you're going to make a 180-minute long movie and expect us to invest ourselves in the lead character, why not show more of his anger and thirst for revenge (see THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO for a great example of this)"
NEGATIVE	this book is very biased,not hard to understand seeing this book was co written by an israeli.israel and iraq has been arch enemies for a long time,how can a person who was taught to dislike and hate hussein write a non biased book on the man.i'm waiting for a biography of saddam hussein written by an iraqi author who can tell us what it really was like knowing saddam hussein and living under saddam hussein years in power in iraq.
POSITIVE	I thought this was a decent collection. Information is collected from several interesting sources, including a personal friend. If you are in agreement with linking an artist's private life closely with their work, then this collection does justice to the stories behind Picasso's art. It's a bit of a haul, time-wise, but well worth it (I watched it in chunks).
NEGATIVE	"I seem to have a different view than the other reviewer. The book got off to a bad start when, on page 4 (page 3 is the first text page) the authors attributed to Newton a philosophical question the Bishop Berkeley actually propounded. This was followed by a couple of other science distortions before we got onto the NLP part of the book. I found the review of NLP to be cursory and incomplete. Nor were any new insights brought to light. Perhaps as much as 40% of the book (all 230 pages of it) was real or imaginary client interviews, which means a lot of white space.Save your time and your money. Even Anthony Robbins has a better exposition on NLP (although it is buried in a lot of ""feel good"" text)"
NEGATIVE	I had to order the item twice because the first one had NO CD IN THE CASE ! I sent an e-mail about the situation but never got a reply.
POSITIVE	Hi!.This here is somewhat of a compilation , of the sheer musical genius that was Quintesence, ..a hybrid of English & Australiann musicians, with a penchant for 'sounds Indian'! The flute playuing(Raja Ram), & vocals (Shiva) , were truly exceptional, all the tracks here are truly recommended, especially Notting hill gate, Dive deep, Twilight zone, Move into the light, St. Pancras...WHAT A WONDERFUL THING TO OWN qUINTESSENCE, NOW, ON C.D.!!They sound even better than ever!!!Of all the innovative 'progressive ' rock bands of that golden period, the early 1970's, Qiuntesence forever hold a special place in this listener's heart!!!Dive deep into this collection--if you appreciate relaxing/exciting/inspired music, you'll love the extraordinary blend of musicians that was Quintessence!Highly recommended !BUY!!!!
NEGATIVE	"If I could provide zero stars, I would, but unfortunately I have to give this book 1 star. Had the authour noted the title has already been used in a 1985 Chuck Norris Movie? What will his next title be...""All Quiet on the Western Front?"". Aside from ripping off the title from another ""artistic"" work, this book is filled with cliches. Cartoonish in character development, boring in subject matter, one must ask ""Why I am reading this?"". I kept reading it as I could not beleive it was so bad. Zero original thought, zero style - was it written by someone in grade 9? The author should consider taking a night class at a community college on creative writing, and then perhaps realize he can't write, and then consider becoming a janitor."
NEGATIVE	How can anyone squeeze all the joy and life out of Disco, I don't know - however Mr Andriote manages to do just that. I found myself humming Gloria's Gaynor's anthem, wondering if I could indeed survive one more page.And is it in poor taste for a writer to review his own work? As Donna Summer would say, BAD GIRL!I will say this - there was a DISCO INFERNO in my fireplace, when I throw this one on the fire. Hey, book burning isn't always a bad thing - especially if HOT STUFF is the kindling.
POSITIVE	I had a great experience ordering this product and watching the movie they shipped it actually two days earlier than promised...
POSITIVE	THIS BOOK READS AS IF IT'S TRUE. IT'S VERY INTERESTING AND SET IN THE MEKONG DELTA AREA. SEAL TEAMS DID MULTIPLE MISSIONS IIN THAT AREA DURING THAT TIMEFRAME. THE BOOK IS VERY MUCH LIKE ANOTHER SEAL'S BOOK SOLD BY AMAZON. I BOUGHT BOTH WHICH IS NOT NECESSARY. IF YOU BUY ONE I DON'T THINK YOU NEED THE OTHER. MANY OF THE MISSIONS ARE TOO SIMILAR. GOOD BOOK.
POSITIVE	I can find glowing reviews for ANY cd on The 'Zon, but not even a bad one written for Ike Reilly's newest. That's a shame, peoples, because you're not in on it. Don't blame me, I had no idea you were so uncool. This is a classic rock and roll album for the present. Some metion Dylan as a reference, but there's nothing folk about it. It uses bits of most American pop of the last 50 years and kicks it out in a shambling, drunken, druggie, classic punk rock song fest. It pretty much rocks. If you drink, smoke and like rock n' roll, you'll like this a lot. If you jog, meditate and eat vegetables, you'll still probably like it. Get in on it now, and I won't tell your friends about the lameness. Have a nice day.
POSITIVE	I have read several Lehrer novels. I believe he is a very underated author. All of his novels are very good. Others here have summarized the book. Lehrer does not high brow you, plain simple writing, easy on the reader. He usually has very good historical research interwoven into his novels. You feel good after reading one of his novels. The book is more about friendship and a description about mental hospitals in the 1920's. It is a good read.
NEGATIVE	I only read the first few chapters and was bombarded with references to 1999 as the end of the millennium. Next year is the end of the millennium, the new millennium starting in 2001. I didn't even finish the book.
POSITIVE	You want stock car racing as real as a simulation game can get, then this game is the ticket. As with all games, make sure you system requirements are far beyond the minimum or that is what you will get...the minimum experience. If the requirements say the minimum is a 32m graphics card, then get 128m card. No reason to give this one star because your system components are barely making it. Also make sure you get a wheel, or don't even bother buying this game, as the racing experience will be arcadish with a keyboard. I have a AMD 1800+, 512m of RAM, and a 128m MSI GeForce Ti 4800, and this game simply rocks. With all the mods, car and truck paint schemes, setups, etc...this game will last for some time. Then join an online league and compete from the safety of your own home. Even Dale E. plays this game to practice without the hassle of real wear and tear on a real car. If a real NASCAR driver uses this as a tool for racing, that says alot about this game.
NEGATIVE	This product not only has a terrible smell, but it attracts bees! I put it on myself and my two small children and, each time we went outside, bees flocked to us. Needless to say, my kids were scared and wanted to go back inside. I'm throwing this stuff out!
NEGATIVE	Ouch - I bought this thinking that my kids would enjoy it. I had fond memories of this being a fun show, a little strange, but good for little kids. Oh my this was so bad - my 8 year old was rolling his eyes after 3 min into the film, that past week has been then talking about how bad the acting, and special effects were in this show. Definately not a high point in Jim Henson's portfolio. Better left as a fun childhood memory, because if you watch it now the happy feeling will be gone.
POSITIVE	This is what techno is all about. totally fresh beats. futuristic cinematic sound scapes. funky as hell. happy funny warm jazzy mysterious awesome.Really, listening to this CD is like going to school. Why a 909? Because in the right hands it has a random accent and texture that sounds accoustic. This CD has nice goofy electric feel that makes you feel like you're rolling on e or peaking on acid. truly magickal.You can't even imagine a drum machine sounding this funky. I swear it sounds like african drumming.THis has some of the best electro beats ever made. I wish timberland and all those southern hip hop and booty djs listened to this.lots of folk have used the same formulas. Somehow hawtins music is a million times better. You can't even imagion how good this music is. The beats and textures are magic, every once in a while there is a catchy goofy melody thrown in thats really cool.
POSITIVE	This book makes an incredible gift. I, personally, can't wait to color in these beautiful Tibetan Drawings. I have always loved the art of Tibet and admired the meditation involved in producing it. I think it is a brilliant idea to make a book that allows all of us a chance to participate in this sacred tradition.
POSITIVE	I bought from the 3 types of Olay total Effect, and I did try them after reading the instruction, There is no magical effect apeard after 1 month but there is diffrence, The company was very good in logistic maters.
POSITIVE	The G5 has replaced a whole bunch of appliances in my kitchen. Just love it the ease of operation is wonderful and the food is healthy!
POSITIVE	Can you say play it loud? Brings back songs I had forgotten I listened to in the 80s. A real treat.
POSITIVE	Mr. Lukeman knows what he's talking about in this book. His warm, witty style and solid, practical advice are invaluable for writers of fiction and nonfiction alike. As an editor myself, I wish more writers would read this book, and then take the time to apply his principles to their work; not only to the first five pages, but to every word.
POSITIVE	"When I first bought this fiddle I expected it to be a lot more clunky than it was.I took it to the local music store to have it set up. The woman who worked there said (paraphrasing) that ""for the money, it's one of the nicest I've seen""She had to adjust the bridge (it had no notches), add fine tuners (my personal preference), and carve out the peg holes (she said they weren't as conical as they should be).After she did those things it held a tune very well and the tone has greatly improved.I'd recommend buying this and upgrading the bow to a nice composite to have a great parking lot picker set up that could last you a while until you decide to upgrade."
POSITIVE	Franklin music lovers will want to get a glimpse of his life and learn about his humble Ft. Worth, Texas beginnings. This was a boy who was laughed at when he was a kid, who considered himself 'weird,' and who got into enough trouble to get kicked out the house a few times. But God's hand was upon this musically gifted man, and the rest is history. You may laugh, cry, and rejoice as you read about the trying experiences of one of this decade's most observed and celebrated gospel artists.
NEGATIVE	"I cant believe this book has as good reviews as it does. I found it boring and totally predictable. I had the ""killer"" fingered half way thru the book. It drug on and on."
NEGATIVE	This book was not about Genevieve and Haydon, it was about the children. Karyn Monk has such potential but I don't think she knows what type of book she wants to write. Her writing is far more intelligent than some other writers, but she needs to entwine that intelligence with a romantic plot. She strays from what the romance reader wants to read. I wouldn't recommend this one for fans of the romance genre.
POSITIVE	These are great weights. The outside handles are extremely comfortable elastic and the weights, in my view, are not unduly wide (but I have average to large sized hands).I would, however, caution anyone planning on using these for kick boxing. The bean-bag style of these makes them very comfortable for this, but because the length is quite long, as you punch, they're going to shake a little. This will give you the feeling of some sort of a connection or oomph at the end of your punch, but you may find that you feel like you're waving a shaking instrument around or something.Still recommended for kick boxing, but just contemplate whether this is a sensation you're going to like.
NEGATIVE	I have been carefully monitoring my weight loss regimen with this scale. It has been frustrating because the scale seems to 'remember' the last weight (from the day before) and shows that instead of weighing me again. To thwart this, I grab a few books and weigh myself -- apparently this throws off the memory, because the next time I hop on the weight seems reasonable with my expectations.If someone could please explain to me why this scale is so weird and how I can program it to merely weigh the person who steps on it, then I would be truly appreciative.
NEGATIVE	Although the first movie was somewhat entertaining and original, this is just a vapid attempt to cash in on the franchise. Yeah, kids will like it, but kids like anything with talking dogs in it...
POSITIVE	Works just as good as the more expensive one from Tupperware. used it a few times works great. Good product, Fast shipping.
NEGATIVE	This is the worst children's game I've ever seen -- bar none. I am a few months away from completing a PhD and I can't understand/remember the confusing directions... Can you imagine how frustrating it is for my 4 year-old and her friends? The game is so complicated and so devoid of fun that we have never finished it, and whenever we play it, everyone ends up unhappy. And ditto what everyone writes about the cheapness of construction and the pain-in-the-butt set-up. I hope Disney pulls this from the market -- it's so awful I am not even going to give it to Goodwill, I'm just going to trash it.
NEGATIVE	I was disappointed in this. I love Poirot, I love Christie, but this was only mediocre. I could get this type of mystery from Dorothy Gilman or someone else who mass produces mystery. Don't get it, please!
POSITIVE	"Morrissey shows us here in his first solo album that his music and especially lyrics stand at them own. This can especially be seen in the long song ""Late Night, Maudlin Street"". Long song, never boring. When I had the tape I used to rewind the tape over and over to hear that song. Now with the CD, life is easier doing so and it still touches."
POSITIVE	I enjoyed this book. One criticism though - what self-respecting Admiral would drive a Miata?
POSITIVE	Now, I am back, and I will press Sell yours here on: Stuart Little/The Trumpet of the Swan [VHS] and Good Luck Charlie (2010) 27 x 40 TV Poster Style A. They say when it is out of stock from Stuart Little/The Trumpet of the Swan [VHS] and AT&T U-verse RF: Currently unavailable. We don't know when or if this item will be back in stock. Plus, I did [...]to play the Missing Letter, Word Search, HangMouse, with the Sentence Unscramble and Unscramble the Words. Plus, I love you too!
NEGATIVE	The book was entertaining but there are many fiction books that are much better. Character development is week. I don't regret reading it but probably won't read others in this series.
NEGATIVE	This fan seemed great at first--it was quiet and powerful. After about 2 weeks of use, it started making a rattling sound on the higher speeds. After 2 years of occasional use, it stopped working altogether yesterday. Even though it is technically under warranty still, the warranty is not worth anything. To get it repaired, you have to not only pay to ship it back to Vornado, but they make you include a check for $20 for return shipping & handling. Plus, they say it will take 3-5 weeks to repair. Considering we got the fan for $31, it is not at all worth it to act on the warranty. Maybe ours was just defective...
POSITIVE	The CD is almost (Almost) like being at one of his concerts of which I have been to many. Every womans dream, romantic and the sound quality is wonderful
POSITIVE	Great voice, great songs. Way, way better than Queen of Ghoul's newly released overrated all-squeaks CD!
NEGATIVE	We purchased this product based on consumer reports, ratings. Loved how roomy it was. Everything was fine till 1 year and 1 month. Stopped working. Amana agreed to fix it although it was outside the one year warranty after some conversation. Some electric part had melted.Now it is broken again after two years. Top shelf is not cold. We are told defrost board needs to be changed.Unfortunately it has not worked for us. On a positive note, it helps you clean out the fridge every year and start fresh :)
NEGATIVE	Received saw, immediately set to cutting simple straight cut mahogany. This is without a doubt the worst saw I have ever used. I can't understand why this saw is so terrible, aside of the fact that the teeth looked completely unsharpened! They appeared to be stamped and not sharpened as though the saw missed an entire step on the assembly line. I was looking to replace a 10 year old, never sharpened, Stanley straight back saw. This saw left exit tear-out 10 times worse than that ancient saw.Sent it back the day after I bought it.
POSITIVE	I bought this as a gift for a Joan Osborn fan. I knew only of, a few of her songs and liked them. But have to say after hearing this album, I now have become a fan. What a remarkable voice and beautiful vocal interpretations of songs. She sings with such effortlessness and power. It is such a pleasure to listen to her on this album. I am a 59 year old Rock A Roller, who has found a new avenue of music, that is so enjoyable. My hat goes off to you Miss Osborn. You are a remarkable talent.
NEGATIVE	Don't even bother with this game. I love Red Alert, but Tiberian Sun has nothing new or original. Go back to playing starcraft or get the new Age of Empires.
POSITIVE	what can I say, it's Dallas, Dallas is one of my all time favorite TV shows, a must have on my list, that now I can cross off
NEGATIVE	Hearing that political guru Karl Rove gives a copy of this book to White House visitors, I decided to buy a copy and read it. I was disappointed to find an long winded diatribe, constantly whining about the Great Society, and blaming the social programs of the sixties for the problems of today. Mr Magnet misses the mark by several country miles.
POSITIVE	As described, fast but quiet, the electric motor keeps up to long hours of fun. I recommend this bike.
NEGATIVE	"I ordered this to replace the old stopper for a Whirlaway 191. The shipping charge is ridiculous but I was willing to pay it just to get this ""impossible to find"" part. Unfortunately this part DOES NOT WORK. It is not a valid replacement. I'm glad I only ordered one -- which went directly into the trash since it isn't worth returning and I will never recover the almost 7.00 I paid for shipping."
NEGATIVE	ORDERED EARLY DECEMBER - NEVER RECEIVED. EMAILED LAST WEEK AND NO REPLY. HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND WAIT UNTIL THE HOLIDAY CRUNCH WAS OVER. BUT STILL NOTHING AND WHEN I SAW THE AMOUNT OF POOR REVIEWS THIS SELLER HAS RECEIVED THIS MONTH WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT - I HAVE GIVEN UP EVER RECEIVING THE BOOK. AMAZON NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING.
POSITIVE	This cd is good...but there's some intentional flaws that just shouldn't happen. First off, I'm sorry, but this guys vocals are terrible. He needs to do more than one cut, and even though I don't like them, put some harmonized vocals behind him, like in FAOT. However, the songs are great, besides number 1. Number 6, 8, and 10 are stand-out tracks to me. I'm not saying this is a bad cd, but I feel they kind of went backwards from FAOT. Good job though, and try to focus on the faster side.
NEGATIVE	Ugh. These are absolutely horrible electronic versions of the songs you are expecting. Sounds like somebody pounded them out on the Casio in his garage.
NEGATIVE	Although it looks great, it is made extremely cheap, But not cheap to purchase! Ripped along side after second use.
POSITIVE	The cover art is disturbing as usual, but par for the course to any true NOMEANSNO afficionado.The first two tracks are the best--great riffs and songs that build in intensity and max out at the end--kind of like sex.The last track was annoying at first, but its true value becomes more apparent through repetitive listening. The two drum set combination is something you'll never hear anywhere else.Its great to have a band that deals w/ real existentialist dilemmas in a manner that's inspiring--not depressing.
POSITIVE	I bought this product to be able to charge my Creative Labs Vision M mp3 player directly from AC instead of the vendor-supplied USB connection.I got great results. The product work great!
NEGATIVE	The picture is misleading !!!! In the future if you are showing a picture of the Gold over Black version for sale do not send the silver over dark blue version to the buyer, That's not a very good practice.
NEGATIVE	Lots of clunky sentences here (good English is not Mr. Sterling's forte). I couldn't find anything of value in this snore-a-rama. The ideas were vapid, the scope limited. This book may have been about the future, but it belonged in the Good Old-Fashioned Dustbin of the Past.
NEGATIVE	The item does not match the picture. Instead, the item is a boxy device with an octagonal shaped plastic outer structure that is smoky ink colored. Not nearly as cool looking as the one in the picture. This one goes back.
NEGATIVE	I never got my purchase, never got a mail telling that the were returning the slides, so I think this is not a serious shop and Amazon is losing points with their clients.
POSITIVE	"Fans of popular fiction writer Ken Follett recognize him among the handful of natural storytellers with a gift of never standing in the way of letting the story run its course. His great tale of the centuries-long struggle to build an English cathedral has been nicely realized in a truly epic eight-part (430 minutes) miniseries.Rising from the shadows of Britain's war-torn Dark Ages, Rufus Sewell is Tom Builder, an idealistic mason with a vision of a glorious cathedral ""bathed in light."" But his quest to construct such an edifice to God's glory threatens to expose the dark secrets of ambitious Bishop Waleran Bigod (a terrific Ian McShane). And there's the squabbling offspring of King Henry, Queen Maud and King Stephen who are equally determined to keep those secrets safe.Interesting extras take you behind the scenes with a look at the remarkable sets, effects and story craft involved. From Sony Home Entertainment."
NEGATIVE	I placed the order over a month ago and I still haven't received it. I placed another magazine order at the same time, and that one was delivered last week.
POSITIVE	This is my dog's new favorite place. She is 140 lbs and the material is going strong. She is also not trying to destroy it like every other bed I've gotten her. I would get this product again. This is by far the best bed in the market for a pet.
NEGATIVE	When I recieved this game, it had two HUGE scratches on it, and I tried using a disk saver, but that didn't work. So now I have a game that doesn't work. :(
NEGATIVE	"So I've been using the curt switch ball with my f150 for the past month or so. I regularly tow a few different trailers and need to switch between the 2"" and 2 5/16"" ball. I got this so I wouldn't have to carry 2 different ball mounts around in my truck, and it fulfilled that purpose. Heres a big problem I've run into though. When it gets cold, due to thermal contraction or something, it becomes really difficult if not impossible to swap the balls out. At first I thought it was rust forming either on the stem or the balls, but I tried the 1 7/8"" ball which I have never used and it wouldn't go on either. I left it in my house overnight and now I can slide all of the balls on and off no problem. Haven't found a good solution to this yet. Thinking about trying the reese switch ball system to see if that works better"
POSITIVE	Ok its not mel brooks best films (Blazing Saddles , The Producers and Young Frankenstein) are far better, but I give 4 stars for a great film (entertaining, and better visual effects than the original star trek/wars) and for Bill Pullman wearing the indiana jones jacket !
POSITIVE	"I expected this book to be light entertainment and it delivered. It is quite funny and features a smart and witty female detective as the lead. Her character was a real woman - one with flaws, which made her much more interesting. The writing style is true to the South - have lived in those parts and I felt the author captured the ""feel"" of the area. I would like to read more in the series."
POSITIVE	It is more than three decades since Schumacher and Daly wrote the seminal works of ecological economics. While there have been numerous contributions to the field since then, the ideas have remained outside the mainstream. The rising spectre of climate change might be enough to change that though. The threat that climate change poses is the basis for Simms' argument for a new way of thinking about economics. Simms argues his case clearly without using jargon.This book is a very accessible read for anyone interested in the problems of climate change and some possible solutions.
POSITIVE	My son has been watching the old westerns with the cowboys wearing these and wanted a pair. He loves them and it cracks me up to see him wearing them around the house.
NEGATIVE	What's the difference between Whitney Houston and my car???My car can hit 50!I hated this album when I was five. I still hate it.
NEGATIVE	"Fleshgrind's debut album ""destined for defilement"" should've been good, due to the fact that its their debut, but sadly it just sounds like all of their other albums. Suckss. Dont waste you hard earned money and go listing to some real music...Skip this garbage."
NEGATIVE	I would never make most of the recipes - too many ingredients and way too time consuming. I like quick easy recipes that are calorie-friendly.I would like to add that Amazon was very prompt in sending this product - received it a few days earlier than expected. Great service.
NEGATIVE	"I had heard all the hype about this film and Ginger's Oscar, but after several viewings, I still find the film rather flat as an experience, and Ginger's Oscar is still a mystery. I guess it proves the adage about winning one ""For women, play plain or ugly (remember Charlize Theron) or play against type"""
NEGATIVE	if this guy really saw something take place...why did it take him 9 years later to write this book? and why didn't he go to authorities? you mean to tell me that he'd rather write a book ($$$$$) then go to authorities?? and why didn't tom sneddon ask him to testify?? AND why didn't THIS guy simply speak up and be a witness to the prosecution?
POSITIVE	This is a really fun product to enjoy in place of popcorn while watching TVI like the fact that this doesn't have any artificial sweeteners. I am allergic to every one of those out there.
NEGATIVE	this is a terrible book. i was wanting to learn how to use the things that nature provides to build things such as wigwams tepee etc... and not have to rely on having a home depot around. if u want to know how to live of the land then dont buy this book
NEGATIVE	bought the cyberhome portable dvd player as we have a cyberhome dvd player on our surround big screen tv and 1 in our rv they are great. the potable didnt have a real on off switch and would not put up a real menu would not read alot of ones we burnt or bought just shut off and was running of the electric part. thought it would be great. was told at target we could return it but not told of a restocking fee with it 15% and that was money we didnt get back .so very dipleased with the unit and the survise we got
POSITIVE	I kinda like this. I live in the U.K. and it's No.1 over here. Well, it's better than Lolly's Viva La Radio anyway! That's soooooo annoying!
POSITIVE	The graphics were very good quality and very close to how the game would be on a console. game play is slightly different then what you would be use to, but not hard to figure.
POSITIVE	From the film to the DVD extras to the amazing interface, not to mention the full, original soundtrack by Austin, TX super-group, The Gourds, this DVD is great. This is a gift anyone would love to get. You can't duplicate this kind of authenticity. We're Shamrock bound!
NEGATIVE	This product is simply useless. If you are considering this product and want any sort of support then DO NOT buy this cushion. It is too soft, too mushy, and lacks any level of support. Pay the money and purchase the $30+ one. I will be buying the better one with the hope that I will get the cushion that I need for relief.
NEGATIVE	Although the purpose of this toy is great, the quality of it is not! While playing with it appropriately, my daughter ripped off the ball release within a half hour on the first day she got it. I emailed the company and they sent me a free replacement. The replacement only lasted for about a month. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone!!!
NEGATIVE	"Bought this in July, and yesterday a 1/2"" jagged crack opened in the middle of the reservoir casing - not even near a seam. Called Braun, and they told me that it is no longer manufactured and, therefore, not under warranty - even though, as far as I'm concerned, it's only 7 weeks old! Amazon won't take it back: it's more than 30 days since we ordered it.That was our third Braun, and our last."
POSITIVE	All of the great Ice-T hits are on one album! What more can you ask for? This is one of the best greatest hits albums ever and I recommend it to anyone who likes hip hop!
NEGATIVE	if you have a curriculum you need to follow, save your money. Just OK but doesn't tie into what we use.
NEGATIVE	This is an awful book for MCAT preparations, especially if you've taken a decent Biology course in college. There are by no means enough practice problems, maximum 10-11 questions at the end of each chapter, the material is far too simply described, and sparse. Reading a textbook is far more useful.
POSITIVE	The main problem is that Dana albums are not available everywhere.. in my country they are banned.. i thought i can buy them throughout the net but most of the CD are singles.. anyhow, the album Free is very nice..
POSITIVE	What a great supprise when I got my package and opened it first class presentation with a booklet full of great photographs and of course the umbrella I havent opened it up yet also havent watched the dvd as I wh\ant to watch it on my theatre screen thanks again especially for the half price deal and postage to australia was prompt less than 14 days regards Keith Reece
POSITIVE	I actually got this book as an advance copy....I feel it is one of the most wonderful books Anne McCaffrey has written yet!! I'am a long time Dragon Rider fan and was amazed how diversified Ms.McCaffery's writing is! This book draws you in and takes you on a thrilling ride through Space to places unknown. A Fantastic read!! I recommend this to anyone who loves Anne McCafferys work!!! I LOVED IT!!!
NEGATIVE	"The description of ""universal fit"" is misleading. It was much too big for my Hyundai Accent. Plus hard to install. Better off to buy entire shaft assembly."
NEGATIVE	We have this seemingly awesome collection of crayons from Alex. Mt girls were so excited to receive them. They are really into coloring and who doesn't love a brand new set of crayons? Other Alex products have never disappointed me, but these are awful. They break. They do not color true to color. There are repetitive colors so not nearly 100 different ones. They color like very cheap crayons and we ended up getting rid of the set. Too bad. A great, fun concept gone terrible wrong with sub-par product. Stick with trusty Crayola and save your money!
NEGATIVE	I found the HBO series rivetting...so I rushed out and bought the book. Speilberg and Hanks tell a much better story than Ambrose, even if they glossed over the truth a bit. In the series, the soldiers do come off as real heros. In the book, they just seem like whiners. I was surprised at how much Captain Winters goes on and on in the book badmouthing officers both above and below him in rank. In his opinion only Captain Spears and himself seem to be worthy of any credit for the 101st's achievments. It get's tiring hearing soldiers go on at length about the greatness of their company. The producers of the series were right to minimze this...it just seems tachy to be still complaining about other soldiers 50 years later.The letters of a private Webster are quoted at length, simply copied page after page into the book, so much so that his name should have be under Ambrose's on the cover.
NEGATIVE	I have to agree, I am very disappointed with the software and services...don't like the idea of talking to a computer or calling long distance. My biggest problem is losing all audio files when video is copied to DVD. I paid 100 for a DVD of an occasion and when I went to copy with this software, I lost all the original audio tracks on the tape:-(...mine was also buddled with Plextor DVD-burner. I have to think twice before I buy another of these products as I now am shopping for something better to replace this software...I also have Pinnicle and with the rendering and failing to copy over to the DVD, it's just about as bad...customer service is better though.
NEGATIVE	I thought I was ordering an umbrella as pictured, but I was contacted by the company to tell me it's just a subway map that I can get for free at any subway station. Very misleading.
POSITIVE	"Granted, the most recent edition came out in 1974, but Words Into Type is still the reference I turn to first with grammar and usage questions. (For style, I keep the NY Times Manual of Style and Usage handy.) Unlike the Chicago Manual of Style, WIT has a usable index that must have been put together by a mind-reader. It's organized the way people think and usually anticipates the form my bewilderment will take: Does ""what"" take a plural or singular verb? The answer's under ""what"" in the index. Should I say ""as if it was"" or ""as if it were""? Look under ""If clauses."" Is it different from or different than? The index leads me right to my answer. I wish the editors would come out with a new edition, but for now I'm loyal to the increasingly ancient Third."
NEGATIVE	Tea Tree oil is the identical same thing as Neem oil -- which my dog has already been determined to be sensitive to. No where in the product description (nor on the label!) does it disclose this; I found it on the Internet when my dog began having a similar reaction to a Tea Tree spray as she did to the Neem oil she'd used previously. I'm returning this unused so can't review it otherwise but Amazon or someone should disclose this.
NEGATIVE	"Spoiler alert - if you saw ""Full Impact"" you know how this one ends, unfortunately the acting and special affects are not as good. Not even close."
NEGATIVE	mi criterio fue que nunca me llego el producto quisiera saber que ocurrio y gracias espero una respuesta no llego no llego
POSITIVE	I started reading the Sweet Valley High series before I was even in high school. I continued to read the series through my own high school career. I'm now a Senior in COLLEGE and I'm still reading the books.This final book is a wonderful read. Jessica feels the same aprehension about graduating that I do. It also allows you to revist with old friends Winston Egbert and Enid Rollins. As the twins relieve fond memories; you the reader will too.If you currently are or ever were a Sweet Valley fan buy this book. You won't be dissapointed and you'll cry on graduation day just like I did.
NEGATIVE	"I bought one of these and a large one (3000 watt) but in less than two years both have failed. Both different failures. Contacted the comapny, they say they do not service thier product because it is not ""cost effective"". If you open one of these up you see that componets are haphazzardly soldered, some not even mounted on boards. Very poor build and parts qualityand no wiring digram available, so after spending $600.00 if it works for a year and then a $2 resistor fries or something ele inside breaks you have to just throw it away. Spend a few more bucks and get one that will last longer than a year and is backed by a comapny that makes a product that will last longer than its warranty and that can be serivced when it does break."
POSITIVE	I love my rio. It's tough, sleek, pocket sized and easy to use. I recomend it to anyone looking to use it as just an mp3 player. If you were however considering using the mic for anything other than personal voice notes keep looking. I purchased my rio with the hope to record and play back lectures. Unfortunatly the mic is not anywhere near sensitive enough to be useful, so i'm passing my little rio on for something new.Creative Labs new Zen Vision :M is boasting a lecture quality mic as well as fm, 30gigs, movie quality olcd and an MS office linking organiser. Alot of reviewers are calling this thing the ipot killer and they might be right. I am so in love with these funky swiss army knife style gagets! If they can slap a phone on that thing, and get some internet access they might have a chance of taking down the crackberry too.
NEGATIVE	We purchased this mobile after seeing all the rave reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, I guess we're in the minority. When the mobile arrived the music worked but the motor did not. We had to take it apart and fix it before we could get it to turn. Then, one of the leaves wouldn't work correctly (it stayed stuck in the up position unless you manually tapped on it). I also agree with other reviews about the music being a little too quiet. It's too bad because our daughter did seem to enjoy watching it turn. Anyway, this was a return item for us.
POSITIVE	"Sense Field was a very dynamic group to come out of Los Angeles during the grunge scene during the late 90's. They are definitely NOT grunge, but they had something to prove. They helped influence many of today's indie punk artists. Lead vocalist Jonathan Bunch is now the vocalist for Further Seems Forever, a great Christian indie punk band. ""Found You"" is a great song, especially with the opening drum line and the guitar lines that take you back to 1994, such a great year. ""Today and Tomorrow"" is a great opener to this indie punk classic. ""Killed For Less"" is an essential to anybody's CD collection, especially the one who like today's indie punk generation of bands like Taking Back Sunday, Further Seems Forever and Senses Fail (both names sound alike). Definitely recommended."
NEGATIVE	I've got it very fast and was very dissappointed.It's not authentic... and it's defenetely not a smell as Vera Wang parfume.Please, do not think that Vera Wang can smell so bad.... as this liquid...
NEGATIVE	It looked like it was returned to Amazon after someone dropped it out of a 2 story window. It was bent, dented, and broken. I sent pictures of it to Amazon when they sent me an e-mail for feedback on the packaging, but have not heard anything back from Amazon. The packaging was very good, so I believe someone bought it, dropped it, repackaged it, and sent it back to Amazon. Amazon apparently did not check it before they resold it. I am very disappointed with Amazon, and wish that this review would allow me to add the pictures of the unit that were already sent to Amazon.
POSITIVE	This is an excellent DVD (movie) and I think everyone should be required to see it. It is informative and answers many questions about health and diet.
POSITIVE	"Smooth transaction. Arrived quickly and in good condition. Quality of item meets my expectations. Heavy base holds lens and ""hands"" steady. Very happy with item, price and vendor. Would definately order from this vendor again. I use this at work for soldering and positioning small components. Works great!"
POSITIVE	this stuff is great for around the house and for use on the set. wont damage delicate things you stick this tape to. glad i bought it.
NEGATIVE	I bought this because it is where Celtic Thunder got their idea to record 500 Miles.Most of the Scottish Folk Songs are not entertaining to me, but I am glad I have the music.It is fun to hear the scottish accent.
NEGATIVE	"OK. Why is there a picture of a Tshirt now? I ordered a hat, claimed to be ""fitted"". Turned out being a one size fits all hat with velcro adjustable strap. Hat didn't fit well. Ended up in the garbage can."
NEGATIVE	hate it!!! wrong color.. the color looks like its pinkest but it turns out its completely purple. be careful some pictures isn't what you think it is...
NEGATIVE	I am pretty unhappy with the performance of this product - my formerly powerful system now sounds tinny and flat. The band cut-offs don't seem to be the same as what they are labeled as either. Only install this if you're a fan of anemic midrange.
NEGATIVE	I am the first to admit, I love the Simpsons... but, this game, after about two weeks gets to be the same old. Yes, there are plenty of things to do, but without a real plot, the game begins to bore even the greatest Simpsons fan.
POSITIVE	I have needed this for a long time. I have SAD, and this light box really does help me! It's lightweight and super easy to use. I am a happy camper with this purchase! ;-)
POSITIVE	$50 for a 30 minute video is pricey under any circumstances, but ultimately it was worth it for this very rare personal glimpse at a man who was justifiably called the master of the now-archaic art of traditional matte painting. The universal admiration for the man and his talents was quite evident in the interviews with famous directors and producers included here. It's particularly fun to see how much Mel Brooks respected Whitlock, and watching him trade quips with the master in the screening room was an unexpected bonus. Recommended if you are old enough to fondly remember old-school movie magic and the people who created it, carefully by hand.
NEGATIVE	I would be happy to write a review since I am the subject of the biography. However I did not know of its existence nor do I have a copy of it. I have some objection to buy my own biography. Could I get an electronic copy for free? M.Cardona@fkf.mpg.deFundamentals of Semiconductors: Physics and Materials Properties (Graduate Texts in Physics)Fundamentals of Semiconductors: Physics and Materials Properties (Graduate Texts in Physics)
POSITIVE	"When I first saw this video I wasn't much into jazz/fusion, but I was very amazed about the bands sound and extreme instrumental skills. The whole atmosphere around this concert (which was held in a church in Spain), is just wonderful. Like Randy Brecker says: ""This is a once-in-a-lifetime band"", and I couldn't agree more!The music is great, the atmosphere, the great video shoots, the funny and interesting interviews with the bandmembers, everything! I recommend this to everybody, not just the jazz/fusion diggers, many will appreciate this. I give it a 10 out of 10. Michael & Randy, Mike Stern, Dennis Chambers and the rest really makes the music happen!"
NEGATIVE	Yet another book by the very (too?) prolific Faye Levy. I was intrigued by the sub-title: what would be sun-drenched in this new book and what are the Lands ( plural) of the Bible ? It is a pity we do not get answers to these questions.In brief, nothing new in this book, written in a unconvincing style.
POSITIVE	I bought this for my nephew and he loved how he could download games to be used on it...the instant he got it he put it to use and so far he hasnt complained so all in all a good buy
NEGATIVE	"I am about to adopt 2 boys and a neighbor said that I just HAD to read this book. I have been reading a number of books that have given clear and positive advice and opinions, this book was not one of those books. I sat down with my highlighter ready to mark interesting passages and quickly realized that there were none. I feel that this book is more about the author's views on the state of the ""traditional"" family, feminism and homosexuality than the unique challenges of raising a boy."
POSITIVE	I bought this book about 6 weeks ago, and just finally read through the whole entire book. I wasnt sure if I could do it, but in only 4 days I have lost 5.5 lbs ! And that was having things I would have never dreamed of eating ! And tonight for dessert, Suzanne's No Sugar Cheescake... It doesnt get much better than that !!!!! Any of you who want to Sommersize together, just email me !
POSITIVE	This is a great game even though it could have been slightly better. For starters the fields look as if they were rushed, The sound crackles when engaged in heavy combat. Now for the pros. The enemys can be like 20x bigger than you and you can be fighting up to 8 enemies at once and defeat them all at once, so it gives you a sense of collosal power. Some of the combat gets so heavy with tornado attacks that it is almost impossible to see what you are attacking. The dark tones and dim lighting in the game gives you a sense of mystery and danger. No matter how strong you get enemies from this versions feilds and dungeons can't be beaten with just on hit. For those you have played the first one the magic goes up to level 3.
POSITIVE	I just got this camera and it's got great detail in the pictures. I put my daughters picture as the background picture on my laptop and you can literally sit there and count the eyebrows hairs on her! It is easy to use, lightweight and its very easy to download the pictures using the software and usb cable that comewith the camera. The only thing I would like to change about it is the zoom isn't too much, only 3x and the videos you take are so huge you can't email them. They have a compact version of the video you can take but then its so small when you send it you can barely see anything. And one of the reasons i got the camera was to send grandparents little short video clips which isn't really working for me. But as far as taking pics its a great camera
NEGATIVE	There are just some actors who just shouldn't potray the lead role in one of the world's best loved plays. Ethan Hawke is one of them. I've been exhaustively studying the play Hamlet for years and never have I come across an adaptation so poorly done. The movie lacked in emotion and sincerity...it sounded more like some bland read-through of a scipt during rehearsal time. Perhaps the best portrayal done was by Julia Stiles in the role of Ophelia, but even that was not at it's best. This is a movie that would make true Hamlet fans cringe.
NEGATIVE	ok it is very breakable (that is why they say nothing about is duablity) and everyone noce you have it. good thing is it is hands free. gtood thing you could use the lisner for somthing else or on somthing else. bad thing everyone sees it and you shouldnt buy it unless you reily no what you are doeing cuzz nobondy i know did
NEGATIVE	This book should be avoided by young people. My sister was given this book by her teacher and still has problems with anorexia....
POSITIVE	If you want to know what the abortion industry is like, then you should find out from someone who has been on both sides.Read and share. It's a shame more people haven't gotten their hands on this book.
NEGATIVE	This was a cute story. I think it is written for a very young audience, 3 - 5 year olds. My granddaughter is 11 and I believe she will find this too babyish.
NEGATIVE	I am a chemistry idiot and I bought this book specifically for practical advice on how to dilute solutions in the laboratory. I was disappointed. This book gives a five-sentence description of Normality (that includes the more-than-obvious joke) and does not provide any examples (such as the difference in calculating the normality of H2SO4 and HCl. Or, how would one calculate the Normality of a 10% H2SO4 solution?) Alas, I remain an idiot.
POSITIVE	My order came in way before the estimate. These knifes are very high quality and are heavy. I am very pleased with both the knifes and the fast delivery speed. These knifes are dull on the sides and with a sharp point, they are well balanced. I learned how to throw on a much smaller knife . Also you will need a think target because these knifes hit hard.
NEGATIVE	I agree with the prior reviewer. I mistakenly was under the impression this included the original novel (which I highly enjoyed) along with the kit extras. That was my own mistake of course. However, once realizing that, the kit seemed fairy empty, with charts, coupons, and scrolls that you can only use once. The cards are reusable, but that's the main item with content. Other objects seem to serve more as a distraction than helping you write.I do think the presentation of the kit and design is rather nice. But overall, it feels fairly empty for someone looking for solid, reusable helping content. Subjectively, I felt it more worth a price under $10.
NEGATIVE	I AM CURRENTLY READING THIS BOOK AS A MANDATORY OUTSIDE READING BOOK FOR MY 11TH GRADE ENGLISH CLASS. I AM ON CHAPTER THREE AND I STILL HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT IS GOING ON EXACTLY. FAULKNER'S USE OF WORDING IS EXTREMELY CONFUSING AND DOES NOT CAPTURE THE READER AT ALL.ALONG WITH READING THE BOOK WE HAVE TO COMPLETE A PROJECT EXPLAINING THE PLOT AND MAIN THEMES. HOW CAN I DO THIS IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK ITSELF?THIS BOOK IS SAID TO BE A GREAT PEICE OF AMERICAN LITERATURE BUT I DISAGREE COMPLETELY.I THINK IT'S REALLY BAD.
NEGATIVE	The item was a Christmas gift and was unfortunately missing the 5th disk of the first season. I would like to exchange it for a complete series.
POSITIVE	THis is what comedies are all about. This movie is an example of how a comedy can be really great. The cast is in top notch performance, the special effects are fantastic but not overwhelms the movie, God, everything is fantastic here. You can see clearly that all the actors,. the director, everyone involved believe in what they are doing and are havin fun doing it. Congratulations !!
POSITIVE	This workbook with phenomic awareness, practices handwriting and recognition of sight words - yes, colours,...The activities are just like those children do at school.I would buy the series for the higher grades.
POSITIVE	I was very disappointed to find the DVD was not actually the full Season 1. Missing from it are the Hardin family, Tugwell family, Imbriani family, Mc Crory family and the Friends Helping Friends episode.
NEGATIVE	"I would not recommend giving this book to a child. The message it sends is one of hopelessness. Its plot centers around the abuse and blackmail of newly-orphaned children, and it smacks of pedophilia. (The villian blackmails a fourteen year-old girl into marrying him by dangling her baby sister from a tower, then speaks of his bride going home with him for their ""wedding night"".)Don't waste your money. There are many wonderfully written children's books out there that are in much better taste."
NEGATIVE	The top part is the same as the smaller coffee mug oxo makes. This makes it great to drink from, but horrible to pour out of. As others have said the insulation isn't the best either. To me it wasn't a waste of money since I'm just going to use it as a giant mug and I don't need it to stay warm until the evening. Last time I used it, I filled with 200 degree F coffee and at 6:00 am, I didn't use it until 2 pm and when I poured it out it was room temp maybe slightly warm.So used as a large mug, used immediately (or within a few hours) after filling, it's not bad.EDIT (end of Dec 2009):I just threw it out. It doesn't hold heat anymore (about 1 month of use) and there is nothing redeeming abou it anymore.
NEGATIVE	"Argento used to be one of Italy's best film makers, unfortunately with ""Trauma"", this and ""Phantom of the Opera"" it looks as if the old boy has completely lost it. This film holds none of the magic and mystery of his other films and is competely lacking in style. Asia Argento is very pretty but totally unbelievable in the part of the policewoman. She is years to young and whoever decided on her for the part must have been blind. There are moments in this film where I'm sure I must of blushed in embarassment for Argento the acting is so incredibly BAD. Unfortunately the film is completely lacking in style as well and Argento seems to have become interested in CGI and treats us to some of the most pointless CGI visuals I have ever seen. My advice is give this film a wide berth... but then it's all a matter of taste and Argento fans will have to see it... Just make sure you rent before buying"
POSITIVE	My husband LOVES his briefcase! He takes it everywhere. While it's a little cumbersome at the airport, it has been an amazing purchase and well worth the $$. My husband is pretty hard on equipment, too, especially when traveling. This item has withstood a year of traveling, on and off airplanes, etc. and is still going strong. The glue used to secure the inside padding has started to decompose, but a little bit of fabric glue put everything back in place and it's still my husbands favorite carrying case for all his important paperwork and laptop.
POSITIVE	The purchase, delivery, value and cost from Amazon was exceptional as always. The book itself leaves much to be desired, there are few examples to apply to what is needed in 2011. There are a few but they are in the footnotes! Authors have tons of good information but it gets lost in the magnitude of boring text.
NEGATIVE	The case is very nice, it has a very elegant design and it is easy to access the device. But...there is a very big problem, somehow, whenever the palm turns on while the case is closed (for example: to warn you of an appointement)something in the case keeps the screen pressed, not allowing the palm to turn off after the programed minuts. It makes you run out of batteries completely and then you have to reset your palm loosing all you data (that you can luckly sync back from your PC).It's not practical. I wish it worked better....the design is very nice!
NEGATIVE	"IT weighs a ton. It has no ""blow"" power and takes FOREVER to dry my hair. Once it's dry, it's flat. Any natural waves have just given up the ghost, regardless of hair product used.I hate it. And I've replaced it. Waste of money."
POSITIVE	I was taking a chance when purchased this product because it was discounted so deep. When it arrived it is a very well built and solid helmet. The padding is very adequate. It may not be a good looking style but definitly have better feel and durable than some of the helmet I found in retail store and those cost 3 times more.
POSITIVE	This is a wonderful book for preparation Toefl test. The explanation of every chapter is great. I love this book.
POSITIVE	I bought a Craftsman tool set with a nice, pre-formed plastic case back in 1989. Those tools have served me very well over the years. The case they came in had 2 plastic clasps. Over the years, one broke off and the other one finally came off, too. So my nice little case has been a pain in the butt, the tools falling out and going everywhere. This velcro strap took care of the problem. It fits around the case, through the handle and keeps the case securely closed. The 2nd strap is in the saddle bag of my motorbike. I would definitely buy these again.
NEGATIVE	Hoped for better...is not waterproof. Tried to make it water proof with no luck.(used 2 different sprays.) Needs a bigger rain fly. Very easy to put up and take down. The floor is the same material at walls. Dampness comes up thru floor if a plastic ground cover is not used.
POSITIVE	"This Amazon.com listing is for the TWO-DISK VERSION of Sponge's _Rotting Pinata_. But I've now heard from two people who were each sent the ONE-DISK version. As noted above, Disk 2 contains live tracks unavailable in the general release.If you buy from this listing, EXPECT that you're paying extra for the TWO-DISK VERSION -- else you could pay MUCH less. Before buying, ASK THE SELLER to confirm it's the TWO-DISK VERSION. Then, if they try to slide a one-disk past you, file a complaint.It's a great bonus disk, but sloppy &/or shady dealers have to stop taking advantage of buyers who roll over from these ""errors."""
NEGATIVE	"For people who have been caught unaware, the ""New Scofield Bible"" is not a ""Genuine"" Old Scofield Bible. C.I. Scofield died in 1921. The New Scofield was put together in 1967 by an independant committee. They added numerous notes that certainly would not have agreed with Dr. Scofield. Example: Acts 8:12- They talk about baptism being not only done by immersion, but by sprinking and pouring. The KJB explains that true water baptism is by immersion only. They also mess with the KJV text by adding double meanings that are different from the Old Scofield Bible. For people wanting to buy a Scofield Bible because of the author's great umderstanding of the scriptures, should be advised to buy the ""Real One"". For people who don't care, anything on the market will do."
POSITIVE	If you aren't careful, you could dismiss this effort by the Whitstein Bros as just another bluegrass familial duo, but you wouldn't get much farther than the opening track before you realize that there is something a little different here. With the sweet lyricism of Tony Rice or the Everly Bros, and a good splash of frank charm, this eclectic CD is sweet to the ear and good for a weary heart. If there is a moment of discomfort, it is the first time you hear them sing Sounds of Silence with a southern twang, but even that incongrous combination melds into the whole for a thouroughly pleasing effect. It is the kind of CD that you put on at work and hit the repeat button . . . a lot.
NEGATIVE	"This was one of the worst ""romance"" novels I've ever read! It took the heroine waaay to long to warm up to her partner in this novel. While I like when there is some resistance, (don't care for weak heroines) I found myself irritated at every other turn of the page by her off putting attitude. In the end when she finally, finally acknowledges her love, after everything he'd done to prove himself,-I wished he'd left and gone his own way. I was so irritated that I just wanted to hurry up and finish and be done. The ending did nothing to stem the sense of disappointment and frustration experienced while reading this book."
POSITIVE	I read Wuthering Heights a number of years ago and never was very interested in it. I didnt think to explore the other Bronte sisters' works till now - and this book is incredible! The way Jane's emotions are described, her moral struggles, her strength, and the depth of her love, is just moving. I finished this book in two days. The language is beautiful, character development rich, and scenes dont move too slow. Anyone who's been prematurely judged in life or has loved to the point of heartbreak will see themselves in Jane. Amazing. (Oh,and I loved reading it on the kindle - no more wondering what those good old 19th century words mean because the definitions are right at your fingertips!)
POSITIVE	"I read several reviews on this book ""The care & keeping of you"" and finally decided to purchase it for my daughter that will soon be nine. I was apprehensive and opened immediately when it arrived and started reading. It is very imformative and I think ideal for the pre-teen to early teen. Even though I'm a nurse, I didn't know how I was going to dive in to some of these topics (periods, body hair, breast development etc). I think this will be the perfect read, together with my daughter. It also has pictures that get the point across without being too graphic in nature or too childish. It also touches base on other topics...teasing, name calling, feelings of being different etc. Overall, I think it is a very good buy."
POSITIVE	Love in the Fast Lane is a thrilling read. It was on the edge of the seat exciting. Maggie and Scott are memorable characters that really make this story incredible. They sizzle with chemistry the instant their eyes make contact. With fast, moving crisp, witty, dialogue that keeps the story sizzling, Jenna McKnight spins a tale that practically takes the breath away. I love the additional characters of Speed and Grammy and how Scott had to be the go-between. The well-written tale skyrockets and keeps this page-turner entertaining until the end. This reader highly recommends Love in the Fast Lane; an extraordinary story that I loved immensely, and one that I will always treasure!CherokeeReviewer for Coffee Time RomanceReviewer for Karen Find Out About New Books
POSITIVE	This is my son's favorite indoor activity. It seems comfy and quite secure, a nice alternative to the hard plastic swings.
POSITIVE	These are Christian songs with Christian lyrics with reality in mind to fit every possible mood including the daily struggle between the world in which we live in and the Christian lives we choose to live.Some of the uplifting songs are very vibrant; slower songs are very soothing to the soul.Definitely would recommend this CD to the Christian listener!
POSITIVE	Nintendo has ended it's life of the Gameboy color with one of it's best all time franchises: Zelda. The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages is one of the best games to come out for the franchise. It is reminicient of the original zelda with it's overhead view. The game is very challnging in puzzles and the story line is similar to Oracle of Seasons. While the graphics are truly 8 bit, for a handheld the color is extremely vibrant. All in all, it's got a lot of replay value when paired with Oracle of Seasons and it is a must have for any handheld gamer.
POSITIVE	In a nutshell these guys are the total package, for anyone who saw them barbershop at the CD release party you know they are all that and a can of corn. Please don't tour with anyone too big fellas, put out 5 more albums and play the Tractor Tavern in Ballard every month. This album will grow on you and make you want to buy it for all your friends.....
POSITIVE	This shoe is well-made, all leather, and smells great out of the box. I have issues with bunions, and so far wearing them causes less discomfort than other shoes, and will probably not cause any discomfort once they are fully broken in. They are a bit long on the toe, the way a cowboy boot might look. I would have liked some fancy stitching, but sometimes simple is the best way to go. I waited too long to get the black, but when they came back into stock, I snatched them up (sadly at full price). So if you see them get down to $150 again, buy, buy, buy. Just don't expect the black to be in stock at that price. :/
NEGATIVE	Only used this product twice in a month since I bought it and it is already broken. Hit a small root with it and it fell apart. I would not recommend this to anyone.
POSITIVE	"...that self titled albums are a band's best. While this album is by no means poor, there is certainly nothing fundamentally wrong with it, it does not compare to their debut ""Up the Bracket"". However, the album is built on the strained relationship between the creative core of the band, Pete Doherty and Carl Bart. This tense writing style is epitomised by the album's flagship song, ""Can't Stand Me Now"".I think that while this record is definitely worthy of any self respecting collection, if I could only buy one Libertines' album, this would not be it."
NEGATIVE	DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!! NOT EVEN FOR FREE!!! This is an old phone, and will be out of production soon. Because it has a bad charger connection. It will stop charging after a little while. You cannot buy the charger from any T-Mobile store!! It is a bad design and they know it!!! They already switched to another charger that's more reliable for other phones.
POSITIVE	Does exactly what it's supposed to do, the 'Carboy Bung Sets of 3' (sorry forgot what size) worked well with these and the tip fit perfect.
POSITIVE	Recommended by my grandfather Chuck Hunt who is a Methodist Minister in Georgia, this book seemed less hocus pocus than a lot of other spiritual warfare books. MacNutt is a decent writer, but he is careful not to get bogged down in the opinions of what he thinks. Because the Bible is incredibly vague on the specifics of demon possession/oppression and excorcism it's very hard to find a person who isn't either totally denying the presence of demons or blaming every little happenstance on demon possession. Whenever MacNutt mentions his own opinion which isn't mentioned in the Bible, he always points out that it is his opinion, unlike many other authors who try to slip theirs in, unbeknownst to the reader. Very imformative book, probably the only spiritual warfare book I would read in a group setting because any others are too far-fetched and people quickly become uncomfortable.
NEGATIVE	This book traveled from the life every kid wants to the most horrific events that left me feeling numb. I thought it was the most depressing book I've ever read. Never again will I buy a book just because Oprah thought it was good!!!!!
POSITIVE	Absolutely love it. I've been using MIDI for nearly 10 years now. This is my first compact MIDI controller and it's actually really really nice. And the software that comes with it is pretty fun.
POSITIVE	First, I would have to say that Vol. 1 is the stronger set, but this collection has its moments too. Flamingo Road and A Woman's Face were my particular favorites. It was always said that Joan was a star and not an actress. How wrong they are. This set highlights Crawford's acting skills which were formidable. Even when one of her movies does not quite live up to your expectations, Joan never disappoints. She put everything she had into every role she undertook and you cannot help but be impressed by such a talented actress. Yes, Joan was one of Hollywood's greatest stars, but also one of its greatest actresses, a true queen among mere mortals.
POSITIVE	in my opinion, BBMak hasn't written or sung a bad song on either of their CDs. all of their songs r catchy and TOTALLY KICK (...)_AWESOME!!! their new CD is just as good if not better than the 1st. you could play either of their CDs over and over again and never get tired of them. i strongly recommend u buy this CD and if u don't already have the 1st one... get it!!! u won't b dissapointed!!! it even has the music video 4 out of my heart which is an awesome song and the music video's even better this CD totally rox and its definatly worth while 2 buy!!!!!
POSITIVE	"The crib arrived today and we excitedly pulled it out. The packaging was minimal but sufficient; the hardware solid and substantial (and nothing missing). The whole thing came together in about 20 minutes, no fuss, no confusion. Overall, I am impressed with the simple but solid design.Oh, and I've heard some people complain about the thinness of the floor material and I would only say this: it is made of MDF, a sort of dense particle board that is very hard. Compare the weight of a 3/4"" sheet of plywood with a 3/4"" sheet of MDF and you'll know what I mean. Our toddler has many pounds to gain before he has any chance of putting a foot through that."
POSITIVE	Search for Significance by Robert McGee is the book I use most often in counseling next to the Bible. McGee focuses on four firmly held false beliefs shared by most people, and then explains that Jesus Christ has provided the answer for these lies that tend to dominate our lives. This book is a life changer.
POSITIVE	I chose to not have children at age 18 - and I've never regretted it. Now in my thirties, I've spent countless hours reviewing and explaining my choice, often for people who had no right to know but insisted anyway. But here, for the first time ever, all the arguments and thoughts I've had about choosing childnessless are discussed in depth and wonderfully in this book. Ms. Lisle wrote the book I would have written if I could have done so. She has my eternal respect and gratitude for putting in print what I've been trying for years to explain.
NEGATIVE	I have been using Norelco since past 3 years. I tried to go for Braun 7526 after reading all the reviews. Unfortunately, my experience was not good.Pros:++ Little bit closer shave then Norelco.++ Good Price. Amazon rocks!!Cons:-- Need to clean every 2-3 days where as Norelco can be cleaned every 2 weeks.-- Unit was not very clean as described.-- Difficult to shave 2 or more days of growth.-- More noisy then Norelco-- Very Low Durability. The foil on my shaver is broken in just 3 months and it is not covered under warranty. So, I need to spend about $30 to replace the foil and cutter as they come together. I will rather discard this unit all together.-- Customer Service at Braun not upto professional standard.
NEGATIVE	Bought mine from this website and the software was not included, even though it said it was in the description. Also the serial number was blacked out so I couldnt register the unit and download the software. Extremely unhappy with the product and amazon.com for selling it to me. never shopping here again.
NEGATIVE	"Another russploitation piece, comfortably confirming for an average American the age-old stereotypes about ""those crazy Russians."" Good bathroom reading though! My advice - wait for the paperback."
POSITIVE	This is a superb publication to grace your coffee table, but beware! It contains graphic images that both titillate and confront - no wonder Crumb is an outcast in his own country.
NEGATIVE	i was really looking forward to watching this DVD, but i was so disappointed, Dont want to judge but when did light and darkness come together, why did Anthony Anderson host it? There was no scriptures said, other than peoples trainers and shoes, awards and achievements, when did God judge the worship we give him, why awards? who is the judge? i felt it was just gospel people showing they can sing and perform, i dont know if GOD RECIEVED ANY GLORY IN THIS. Were people saved? thats our purpose as christians isnt it?
POSITIVE	Ordered these for my sister because she couldn't find any locally. Both our families use them and love them.
POSITIVE	This is a fine summary of Foner's excellent book. As in the full volume, Foner presents many overlooked details about the violent era of reconstruction in the South.
POSITIVE	Roberts takes the census and breaks it down into relevant and meaningful data. Using charts, maps, and other helpful images, He brings the reader into the diverse and complex information garnered from the U.S. census. You'll find yourself quoting many of the compelling statistics given by Roberts.
NEGATIVE	The confusing presentation, clumsy writing, and numerous factual errors make this book almost unreadable.
NEGATIVE	"This is one of those movies that you watch and then, within a few days, you forget about.Sarah Jessica Parker plays Paula, a ""launcher"" or something. Parents hire Paula to coax their adult children into leaving home and getting a place of their own. Sound stupid enough for you already?Paula is hired by the parents of Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) and the story is about how, during the course of her employment, she falls in love with him, and he with her. There are a very few laughs along the way.Some might call this a ""chick flick"" but my wife (who is a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker and ""Sex and the City"") didn't like it either."
NEGATIVE	"This was trouble free for 2 years, now the Sound is cutting out of the Center Channel like so many have reported. Double checked all the wiring - subbed in a different center channel, it cuts out intermittantly still.Many have noted that they had to crank the volume or turn it off/on to fix. I have found that if you simply turn off the ""MCACC Auto Sound"" and switch it back on, the sound will come back.But then the Sound will cut out again later. Happens daily at this point.This will be my last Pioneer I purchase.Now I'm looking at the Onkyo TX-SR607 - it seems to get a lot of good press at an affordable price.PIONEER HAD A DESIGN FLAW with this product!!"
POSITIVE	The real reason I bought this was because of the collaboration Ringo did with Jellyfish and (very little) Brian Wilson. For the bargain bin price I paid for a used CD, the purchase was well worth it. Nothing on here that you will ever hear on the radio, but it is right up my alley, and I do recommend it to any fan of The Beatles, Jellyfish, ELO, etc. I would rate it a solid B.
NEGATIVE	Frankly, this book does not help the critical reader. I tried and didn't get as good an understanding as any other test prep book I've ever read, in any subject. There are numerous errors including spelling, incorrect answers and concepts. Not only that, but the drawings were poor - I wondered what kind of program they were using to make such images. The end product looks like what you might get if you had 5 days to finish it. Only buy if you get a tremendous deal.
POSITIVE	"This was the follow-up to Roll the Bones and saw the band get a lot more into electrical guitar and less on the keyboards and synthesizers to back up the sound. Standout tracks include ""Stick it Out"", the instrumental ""Leave that Thing Alone"", and ""Everyday Glory."" Though probably not as popular as Rush's earlier stuff, from the mid to late 80's, this is a solid album all the way through and displays what the band does best, write good songs backed up by nice guitar, bass, excellent drumming and some keyboards."
NEGATIVE	"I wish I'd read these reviews. Previous OXO products have been of high quality, but not this. OXO should place a warning sticker that this is not dishwasher safe. Washed in the dishwasher once and it came out ruined- the ""chrome"" coating was gone and the metal pitted. I have I high-end Bosch, so I know it's not a dishwasher issue, rather CPS- Cheap Piece of ****."
POSITIVE	Amazon needs to pump up some more of O G Ron C's F Actions. I know he's got a few more out there. Real definitely recognize Real in Germany, Ya bootleggaz!
POSITIVE	Couldn't find anything like this in local stores.Love this curling brush. Hair doesn't get tangled up and it's easy to handle.
NEGATIVE	From the reviews and the storyline on the DVD cover, I was very excited to see this film. Unfortunately, this story was drawn out and had no real direction. The characters were boring, and nothing terribly eventful happened along the way. It was as if a camera filmed a stubborn father's trip on a bike and documented nothing of interest.To cheer yourself back up, watch a good film like 'The Man Who Copied' - also Brazilian and way more interesting.
POSITIVE	This is a very nice book, with patterns that range from easy, for the beginning crocheter, to the more complicated work. As well as the written instructions there are diagrams for the various stitches used, making this book a bit of a primer for those who might wish to learn to read diagrams.The photography is beautiful - lots of cute babies and the designs are first class. The book has stitch instructions and lots of useful tips for the less experienced crocheter. I particularly liked the christening shawl and am now waiting for anyone of my acquaintance to produce a baby so as to give me a reason for making that one!A lovely book for any doting granny.
POSITIVE	I was worried because I sent these books to Korea; today I've got a call that they safely reached my Seoul Home. thanks, AMAZON1
POSITIVE	This review takes the entire trilogy into account. Hobb does a fantastic job with the characters in this series. They are all living breathing people. I am not normally one who likes the first person narrative but Hobb masters the technique. The magic in this series is original and intreging. Book one and two were excellent, the third book drags alittle and the ending left me feeling slightly cheated but over all these three books that any fantasy fan will enjoy.
POSITIVE	"I have been an ""oils"" fan since 1988, and believe it or not ""Diesel and Dust"" is one of my least favorite songs. However, the album, ""Blue Sky Mining"" is by far one of the best!! EVERY song is excellent and evokes a passionate response from the listener. The arranging of the music is perfect, which is sometimes hard to imagine with the amount of lyrics Peter Garret tries to ""fit"" into a melody. From the working mans songs :Blue Sky Mine, and King of the Mountain to the smoky, Mountains of Burma,and rythmic Antarctica, you are transported through every range of emotion and can find common threads no matter where you are from; I'm a Canadian. And once you've heard ""Stars of Warburton"".. the ""Oils"" will have YOU ""shouting to the skies again""....enjoy!!!!"
POSITIVE	I have been using this video 3 times a week for the last 3 months and am very pleased with the results. I still find the workout to be a challenge, so am not tired of it as yet. I like how it combines stretches, flexibility, aerobics, and strength training all in one video, so that I don't have to change tapes. As a 63 year old, I also appreciate the combination of standing and sitting exercises. I would recommend this to a friend if they don't mind being taken back into the 90's world. Three friends and I work out together which probably helps us stay committed to our workout.
NEGATIVE	There are a lot of worthwhile ideas and images in this book, as in Williams' other novels, but the writing style is so often tortuous and obscure that for most people I think it's simply not worth the effort to read.
POSITIVE	I enjoyed this primer (and more than that) on how to play chess. It is written in clear language and will improve almost anybody's game.
NEGATIVE	I was thrilled with how this product looked, and ignored the negative reviews. When used, however, urine can get between the product and the top of the toilet bowl and there's no way to clean that without removing it. And so it stinks.Might be OK on an elongated seat, or if the user isn't male. It just doesn't work for men on an standard (non-elongated) toilet.
POSITIVE	Grandson is a very avid fan of Star Wars and this was one of his wishes, but after he opened it and the thrill wore down, he wanted to know where are the toys? But he does love the Trilogy and watches it quite often.
NEGATIVE	Amazon is out of RED. After waiting for 2 months, they shipped a white while the packing list states red. When contacted, they said that they do not have a red for replacement. If I want a white I can get it elsewhere for $7.99. Not I have to go through the trouble of returning it.
NEGATIVE	I can only speak to one of the mine explosions discussed in this book, the Burton Mine Explosion at Craigsville, WV in 1958. Many of Mr. Dillon's facts were wrong in that chapter. I'd think the names of the miners killed would be easy for him to obtain, yet some of them were wrong. Makes me wonder about the rest of the book.
POSITIVE	THIS is what Paul McCartney was born to do. This COMPLETELY blows away anything he's ever done. This is one of his greatest solo albums, right up there with Band on the Run. Paul can rock, and he rocks his heart out. Rock in it's purest form.
POSITIVE	Both of my children have thoroughly enjoyed the Cluefinder Series, especially this 3rd Grade Edition. I have tried many similar products but have found them to be either to heavy on the education, thereby losing the kids interest, or too heavy on the fun and they don't really learn much. In this product, the children get to work with a small group of kids (whom they may know already from other Cluefinders adventures)as they seek to solve the story/mysteries. I love the way the kids get rewarded for progress during their journey, providing even more incentive to continue. And the best part of all: they really do learn! During dinner one evening, my son showed off some of the math skills he had learned quite far in advance of his school classmates. And it wasn't just rote memorization. He had really learned the concepts. My hat is off to The Learning Company!
POSITIVE	This was a great movie. I would watch it again. It was not over played or unreal.Not hard to follow when it comes to foriegn language.
POSITIVE	John's first novel really moved me with its intimate detail and personal family feel. But this new novel had my head spinning and my tummy doing flip flops. There was so much action and adventure that my head was whirling around, but the warmth and strength and human-ness (if that's even a word) of the characters made me feel part of a great spiritual journey. The story seemed so real to life in the crazy and frightening world we live in but the John's new book shows that tenderness, faith, hope and, like Jesus said, most of all LOVE, will conquer all evil and darkness ... thanks for making me believe in enduring and death defying love John!!!!! Your words are wonderful!
POSITIVE	Very cute children's book that teaches manners! This was an important purchase for me as I would like to instill good manners in my son & this book demonstrates appropriate situations for these manners to be tested out on. Great pictures as well.
POSITIVE	Works just fine on my Archos 504. As other buyers have noted, similar generic products WILL NOT work on Archos players; it has to be specifically compatible with Archos. Sound and video quality met and exceeded my expectations. I haven't tested this, but I would guess that using this cord prolongs battery life as well (because the player doesn't have to power its LCD screen, the biggest power-draining feature).
POSITIVE	I love The Sixteen's performance. Fresh, detail, and precise! Carolyn Sampson, the soprano, is phenomenal. Her vocal quality and technics are superb, but what I enjoy most is her expression of the lyric. She is truly a great actress!The only drawback is the organist Alastair Ross. To me, his improvisation is overdone and I can hardly catch up with his extreme tempo especially when he played the solo part.The BBC production (both sound and image) is in excellent quality.
NEGATIVE	While I think the multiple authors had an interesting idea to create a story about a small town by each creating one of the colorful town characters, it might not be the best read. Personally I found it boring, and am not sure why I continued to read to the end. I simply do not care enough to continue with this series and find out what happens to these characters and their town.
POSITIVE	"These peppers were great for chiles rellenos -- the right size and in good condition (ie, not falling apart). The only disappointment was that each can's quantity of ""about 5"" peppers was wrong. Most we've opened so far had four but a couple only had three, none had five."
NEGATIVE	I have had the original suction cup for Nuvi 660 GPS since Oct 2008. The last few trips I would get it to stick on the windshield of my Honda CRV but as I started driving it would fall off. I had a garmin a few years back that would do the same thing. You would think that they would improve the suction as the they improve the technology. I guess not. I am looking for other options for mounting my GPS in my car. I otherwise love my Garmin Nuvi.Update to review: I have since bought the dash sandbag gps holder and it is only thing that I have found that keeps the GPS in place and not falling out of sight and also can be moved around easily as needed. I would never go back to the suction cups on windshield.
POSITIVE	This charger charged my son's power wheels within 3 hours to a full charge! Our orginal charger took about 12 hours to fully charge, but it quit working so we are so excited to have his truck driving again. I am very pleased with this product and the price I received!
POSITIVE	Same product at mall store $29...Works great... I have had it for 3 months now no problem.
POSITIVE	I purchased several copies of this book to use in business literacy training for employees at my organization. It helped the rank-and-file to understand the numbers on the financial statements and what they can help to improve them. The authors did a great job of taking a complex topic and explaining it in a way that anybody can understand. Who among us didn't try our hand at a Lemonade Stand when we were young. It has some elements of a textbook, ie., a test at the beginning and end, but most definately doesn't feel like a textbook. I received positive comments from all who went through it with me, including a 13 year-old girl or should I say, a 13 year-old accountant.
POSITIVE	Lara DeSalvo wakes up one night and finds a strange woman standing at the foot of her bed. The woman beckons for her to follow. The incident frightens Lara, and she passes it off as a nightmare. When it keeps happening, she begins to suspect that someone is breaking into her house. By the end of the story, Lara will realize who this woman was, what she was trying to say, and the shocking secret her husband tried to hide. The plot was rich and tight, with several subplots weaving into it. However, I thought Lara was too whiny and passive. I would recommend it, though, to anyone who likes ghost stories.
POSITIVE	It arrived in a very large box along with my other order, a heavy textbook. There was nothing preventing them from thrashing about in the large box, no bubble wrap, no paper, nothing. Besides that, the stand is larger than I had hoped for, there is more than enough holes to fit my earrings, and then some.
NEGATIVE	"Not until I was putting the darn thing back in the box did I see the sticker on the box. This module is compatible with 8, count 'em, 8 phones. The Xircom website does not list them when you click for the listing (it takes you to their 56k modem module page instead) and the Amazon site simply says that it is compable with Nokia phones.According to the sticker on the box: ""For Nokia Handsets. This model is compatible with the following handsets: Nokia 6110, Nokia 6130, Nokia 6150, Nokia 6190, Nokia 5110, Nokia 5130, Nokia 5150, Nokia 5190""With all the different mobile phones out there, why any company would make a product that was compatible with only 8 of them is the ring of a poor business plan."
POSITIVE	While my fellow Connecticutonian is probably right in that Howl's Moving Castle is a better book, this one is much easier to get into. A definite winner all around as it has a very satisfying ending even on the first read, a rarity in Jones's books.
POSITIVE	After reading reviews on the game from various forums I decided to give the game a try. I never played this game in it's original content but rather installed mods immediately. I found the game extremely similar to the old X-com (only with improved graphics and more technology options). I have over 40 hours invested in the game and have found it very enjoyable. I would definately buy the game again if I had to do it over.
NEGATIVE	I really didn't like this movie and it dragged to much and didn't have much of a story line to it
POSITIVE	"""Jumper"" turned my brain into a television. It completely absorbed me. The book and I were one.I opened the cover and the story just sucked me in. I actually stayed up all night reading the book and had to call in sick to my work just so I could finish it.""Jumper"" could be a major hollywood production"
POSITIVE	the case is and does exactly what it is suppose to. It is not the hightest quality leather when compared to some of my other cases for other PPC's and phones. Overall it is a good case quality workmanship and sized right.
NEGATIVE	I saw the older good reviews so I decided to get this lock but sadly it doesn't work whenever I try to adjust it according to the size of my steering. It's so frustating!
POSITIVE	I used this pillow for nearly every feeding with my son for a year. It was terrific for the back support, especially, when you didn't have a good chair nearby. It was also very firm and never lost its shape despite my frequent use. As for the reviews that said it's hard to put on and off without using both hands, well I didn't have that problem because you don't HAVE to snap the thing into place. It will go around your waste and around your back just fine without you securing it and stay there. In fact, the only time I really needed to secure it was when I knew I was going to be shifting around. Then I simply put it on before I picked up my baby. It was never an issue!The only con was that it was hard to get the slip cover back on after washing since the foam is so firm. I had to work on getting it to be the right shape again. But that won't deter me from using this pillow again with my second child. I'm actually looking forward to it!
NEGATIVE	was hoping for a good hardwood floor vacuum. It didn't have pads that would prevent floor from being scratched. It was heavy!!! in the middle and fell to the floor as it could not stand up on its own. Expensive and definitely not worth considering. I love a good vac at any price, this was not it.
NEGATIVE	After reading so many excellent reviews I could not wait until these socks arrived in the mail.They looked soft and fluffy and was excited to try them on.Such disappointment.From the ankle up they are very wide, so wide in fact that they skip down and when I walk the sock gets pulled into my shoes.These sock also have less cushion than the $2.00 and less discount brands.I was hoping for a premium sock and I have have a premium dust cloth.
POSITIVE	I just finished this book and I would like to recommend it to other kids because it is the kind of book you can read over and over and over and never get tired of it. She is a little mean but she comes to her senses in the end and is generous and kind.
POSITIVE	I registered for this seat and my 6 month old has loved it from the start. He even slept in it for a couple of weeks when he had pretty bad reflux. There is a nice variety of features-vibration, music, nature sounds, toys. It is nice and large with a very soft suede-like cover and soft rubber feet to protect furniture.
NEGATIVE	"Robert A. Heinlein, a leading writer of science fiction, wrote ""A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read: realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method.""In Stranger in a Strange Land, we're introduced to a human who has magical powers simply by virtue of being raised on Mars. These powers, as of page 333, are not explained. There is hardly any conflict in story, and the conflicts that are presented are written with little skill or passion. Smith dispatches enemies in the action scenes by making them disappear without effort. During negotiations, Smith's lawyer steamrolls the opposition. Most of the prose is spent on the author's pontification. At this point, I'm cutting my losses and shelving the book. I'm going back to Asimov to read some real SF."
NEGATIVE	I don't know why this was there for me to rate. I didn't, and would not, buy this item!
NEGATIVE	THIS DVD WAS WAY OUT OF SYNC----THE MUSIC AND VOCALS WERE OUT OF SYNCWITH THE PERFORMERS. BEING A MUSICIAN IT WAS HARD TO WATCH. HAD TO SHUTIT OFF. AMAZON, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT THE DVD WAS THAT WAY. I'M STILL A CUSTOMER.MICHAEL
POSITIVE	Although dated now, this book is still one of the books I love the most in my collection.Lamothe starts in each chapter with a new topic and gradually solves the problems as they arise with summaries and other notes. A basic knowledge of C and how to work computers obviously will stand you in good stead but even an amature, with determination can pick this book up and really learn from it. Lamothe tends to spring little details on you at the last moment so be sure to read every chapter at least twice.As I said it is a bit old but helps you understand the basics of the VGA card mode 13h, yadda yadda.... Graphics and all other games aspects are covered, even 3D has a little coverage.The Video Games Industry is an impossible thing to follow as advances are every where and a new book is an old book overnight but Lamothe has made a brilliant stab at this.... and succeeded.
NEGATIVE	This vac has good suction but the wand is very short. It is difficult to vacinside of car without having to hold the unit in one hand & vac with other.It won't sit on seat & have wand long enough to vac.
POSITIVE	Great mens' choirs from all over Wales. Wonderful inspiring music. A unique seldom heard sound these days. Selections include choral classics and musical theater numbers. A bargain of 5 CD's.
NEGATIVE	I have had this crockpot for about three years now. I got a Hamilton Beach about six months later. My Rival one has cracks all the way around the walls and bottom of the pot, and there is one that goes all the way through the bottom, just waiting to split. My HB, on the other hand, has ZERO cracks! I use these just about every day for dinner or homemade broth. I am about to buy a replacement for this one, and it'll be a Hamilton Beach crock pot. I gave it two stars, as it worked well throughout those three years.
POSITIVE	I ordered this book for my daughter's boyfriend as a gift. He is hooked on this author. This was a great price. My order arrived on time and in good condition. Would recommend this seller to anyone.
POSITIVE	This movie was excellent. I had avoided it because I thought it was as the critics said. I should have known. The cast was great and worked together well. The premise seemed to have jumped from the airwaves of coasttocoast, which I happen to enjoy, and the technology, well, unobtainium says it all. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, since the real raw material for it was funobtainium.
NEGATIVE	Pretty good book as far as fun and games go, but I wish Mr. Cussler would tone it down a bit with larger-than-life plots and ridiculous ideas. This book would be indefinitely better if the scope of the story did not involve whole continents, 500 presidents, millions of people and so on.Dirk Pitt was meant to be likeable and desireable. Instead, he comes off as an arrogant, selfish fool, who is extremely sure of himself, an apparent sexist, homophobic megalomaniac, and a killer with no remorse, who always finds a way to explain away blowing up people and shooting a person or two.I only recommend this book if you have nothing else to read or if your other reading choice is a local newspaper. There just isn't anything believable about this particular story and the characters are not likeable - there is nothing one can relate to in this book.
POSITIVE	The work well as a pre-filter , and can be reused after washing out gently with water occassionally , I am pleased with the purchase
POSITIVE	Great Movie !!! Matthew B. Pays a great role . And performs excellent , this is back when playing a Gay Man got rumors that you could be gay. Thanks to Matthew B , this is the beginning of straight actors playing gay men and doing a great job.
NEGATIVE	This has to be the ultimate example of moronic, self-serving, drug-induced? paranoia being passed as public entertainment. Hey look! Mommy bought me a toy for Christmas and I can make movies now. Fear? What a joke!
NEGATIVE	Most of the recipes take more than 30 minutes including prep time. Who is Ms. Ray trying to fool. I have a friend who is a professional chef and has been one for several years who we timed while using three of the recipes. The least amount of time it took him and he is FAST was 45 minutes! I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to really get done with cooking in 30 minutes or those wanting to eat healthy. None of the recipes are healthy. Cutting corners using processed foods is hardly healthy.
NEGATIVE	Did not receive hard copy. I would like to receive this book if paid for it. I receive an electronic version.
POSITIVE	The four episodes on this DVD are just an intriging warmup... If you like slow moving anime and not a ton of action this is for you... if your looking for Fist of Northstar anime this is probably not for you. The best comparison I can make is probably Aeon Flux.
NEGATIVE	I bought this secondhand in the hopes I would be able to see my small GB SP screen better. I was wrong. It took a lot of struggle to get the magnifier on. Once on, it flopped back down uselessly, and there was no way to tighten it.Do not buy! It's a waste of money! :(
POSITIVE	This is just your basic clothes bin that goes in the corner of your closet and gets filled. It's not going to make any room, but it won't be an eyesore. The linen look gives it an element of class, just as the blue insides take that away. Brown trim is neutral. But it's an outstanding value for what you pay.
POSITIVE	the range and power on this is average and it is also acurate but you have to know how to aim it. the add on sight doesnt really work, neither does the lazer sight. the sight built into it works but you have to line the top of the back sight with the bottom of the front one.
NEGATIVE	"Being new to the Triangle area, I was excited to read about the storied history of the Duke-Carolina rivalry in an unbiased fashion. In reading Mr. Chansky's book, its clear where his loyalties lie. His text is weaved with snide comments about Coach K and the Duke athletic and academic program, while at the same time lionizing Coach Smith the the UNC progam. Don't be fooled: this is not an unbiased portrayal of Duke-Carolina.Chansky's book could also have benefited from better editing. He spends single paragraphs describing some of the most thrilling Duke-Carolina games, but then rambles on for pages about inconsequential stuff, such as CD Chesley's TV deals or Coach K's American Express commercials (an obvious sore point for Chansky).I wouldn't recommend this book. Probably a better read would be ""To Hate Like This Is to Be Happy Forever"" since its at least honest about its affliation and more entertaining."
NEGATIVE	This is a poorly structured extremely small chair. Company it ships from is brutal to deal with I returned it and still have not been credtte
NEGATIVE	We received this as a present for our son who loves musical toys. The pieces are inconsistent in size so if you tilt the instrument down (as you do with a sax or recorder) the pieces fall off--very frustrating for a young child. Also, the mouthpiece without the other pieces attached is basically a potentially loud whistle, so you won't be letting your kids play with it anyway after they figure this out. A kazoo or recorder is a better way to go.
POSITIVE	I purchased this humidifier after my wife pestered me about how dry it was in our bedroom during the winter. This humidifier is extremely quiet, has solved her dry air problem, and is clearly the best looking humidifier on the market. This is a great humidifier for the price, and I would recommend it for anyone looking to improve the dryness of a bedroom or another room of equivalent size.Unfortunately, our first penguin had a fan issue after about 2 weeks (it got really loud). I emailed Crane customer service and they quickly responded, telling me to return the humidifier for a new one. Once I submitted return on Amazon, we received a new one in about 1.5 days. It has now been a few more weeks and our new humidifier is going strong. Great customer service.
NEGATIVE	"Digitally remastered--only if you consider copying an old widescreen VHS onto DVD remastering. This is a great sci-fi film of 1962. The ""Cheezyflicks"" remastered version is junk--don't waste your money."
NEGATIVE	Definitively a book to be missed.A great premise full of possibilities ruined by an author who has absolutely NO idea of weapons,warfare and the military.I am sorry that i bothered to buy it, i am sure that it will be widely available since no one will want to keep it, unless as an example of what NOT to do ..........
NEGATIVE	Neither of the dvds worked and I still have not gotten my money back or a third replacement I do not recamend this at all!
NEGATIVE	There are other books on Phish -- skip this one. Amazon's doing you a HUGE favor including a review that slight's somethign they're trying to sell, but they're right to do so - this book in nonsense. The author clearly doesn't know much about Phish, and many are under the impression that he just made up most of it. Check on the Usenet newsgroup rec.music.phish for daily ridiculing of this 192-page piece of nonsense. Save your nickels. Phish will attract the writing of many books, and this ain't the one you want.
NEGATIVE	This game will soon die. $OE is an arrogant company that does not listen to it's PAYING customers. Combat is so screwed up and the game is filled with bugs. Stay Away!***** Update 1/03/2013 *****You can now play this on pre-cu servers! Google SWGEmu.
NEGATIVE	According with the title, I Imagen a document with a really good and recent information. Chichen Itza have 1000 times more important things that the Video shows. It never refers to Tulum. It's a real deception.
POSITIVE	I remember watching this with my children when it first came out on VHS format. They both loved it and watched it all the time. It was their favorite movie until they discovered Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Now that my children are gown, I have discovered the movie in DVD and have given it to my granddaughter. She absolutely loves it and drives her mother (my daughter) as crazy wanting to watch it again and again, as she did when she was little. I highly recommend this movie for the younger aged children maybe 3-6 years old. It's entertaining for children and has a wonderful story with a great moral at the end. Adults may get bored quite easily, but the time spent sharing the movie with your children will be priceless. You can't go wrong with this movie if you want to spend a lazy, rainy afternoon with your kids.
NEGATIVE	"This movie was C R A P!! All filler and 10 minutes of ""something"". I give it NO stars if I could!"
POSITIVE	"Many obscure albums are obscure for a reason and never come close to living up to the underground hype. Happily, that is not the case with this album. This is a very well done album. It is nicely composed and arranged, and performed, with nice singing. It is pretty mellow with a lot of organ for the most part, though ""Never Too Far"" is a nice blast of fuzzy-guitar psych. The album has a better than average stereo sound for the era. The ""trippy"" studio effects are used tastefully and contribute to a pleasantly hazy, dreamlike vibe. I think it's one of the best obscure albums of the era. Highly recommended for psych, baroque pop, and 60's fans."
NEGATIVE	We purchased this booster when our 15-month old son was approx. 6 months old. Until this week, it was fine, with the execption of food getting lodged in the strap openings. This week our son pushed on the tray and the t-bar and tray came off. If he wasn't seatbelted in he would have landed on the floor with the tray and t-bar. We reinstalled the t-bar, thinking that it wasn't latched on properly from the previous cleaning, but still the tray and t-bar came off.
POSITIVE	I enjoyed this book tremendously. While the story is based in fictional 'Orham', it is describes the town of Chatham quite well. Lincoln actually lived there for some time. Captain Eri reminds me of my grandfather, who was a retired sea captain and lived in Chatham after moving from P'town. The books are entertaining and well written.
NEGATIVE	Battery powered Thomas is great but this one (Percy) does not stay on the tracks.The battery life is good though.
NEGATIVE	If you plug-in any high draw USB device into it the device will overheat. You can unplug it and wait for it to cool down, but it is really inconvenient.
POSITIVE	This DVD is simply three dances by Hossam's wife, Serena. You can view them all together or one at a time from different angles. It's not good as an instructional belly dance DVD but I liked it because Serena is beautiful to watch and I just loved the way she moved. I've watched it several times and didn't get sick of it.
POSITIVE	The Abandoned should be required reading for anyone who owns a cat and anyone who has ever thought about owning a cat. This story is the adventure of a little boy who suddenly turns into a cat. A delightful way to obtain insight into the mysterious way cat's conduct their social life and why they do the things they do. I was given this book when I got my first cat. It helped me obtain a deeper understanding of my cat while enjoying a story that touched my heart
NEGATIVE	Sure, Watermelon Man (patterned after the Gerald Wilson recording) is fun, but the rest is unimaginative and uninspired. Mostly it's about the band leader's bongo solos, which are boring indeed. A genuine disappointment.
POSITIVE	We got this when our babies were 6 months old and they have loved it from day one. They love the lights and music and now that they are older (8 months), they are able to press it to turn the music and lights on and off. The recommended age is 1 year but I think that is a little old EXCEPT you have to be very careful when your kids are learning to stand that you don't have it near them. If they fall near it, it could hurt a little until they are old enough to control their standing and walking. I definitely recommend this. I don't even tire of the music which is great.
POSITIVE	This book has helped increase my vocabulary and improve my diction greatly, I heartily recommend.
NEGATIVE	Should an artist's personal life be taken into account when judging his work? This book is mostly about Jetsunma's and her student's personal lives and very little about their work. The amount of time spent describing negative incidents becomes depressing. As the author says herself, maybe she is holding these people to a different standard when she is critical of a nun having her own coffee pot in her room. Nuns should be more communal, I guess. Gossip and scandalous details can be intriguing but a steady diet of it is just not much fun to read.
POSITIVE	Purchased for my grandson in Alaska. My son says that the toy is very durable and is played with daily.
NEGATIVE	I have had a Magellan GPS for several years and now have a Garmin Nuvi. There is no comparison and Magellan's customer and technical support is the worst I have seen with any company, anytime. Save yourself a lot of headaches and money and do not buy a Magellan. I like the Garmin, but any GPS would be better than Magellan. ZERO STARS
POSITIVE	An epic clash of good and evil. Magnificently written in a style that kept me yearning for more. Steven Kaye has created intense visual metaphors that will remain with me for quite some time. A great book to lose yourself in for awhile!
POSITIVE	The first time I heard this, I was blown away! This was one of the first fusion albums and still easily holds up today.
NEGATIVE	Most of the other reviewers got it right. Not only did the cover for the seat back not cover the back, it did not cover the front completely either. At least 4 inches of the seat back still shows below the cover on my 77 GMC. There are not enough ties in the box to put the cover securely on the seat or the seat back. The ones that are attached gave the feel the one should not pull them to tightly for fear of ripping the fabric. One of the most dissapointing products I have ever bought on Amazon. Auto Expressions needs to make it clear this product is not as much as advertised.
POSITIVE	I bought this album because I broke the first one (it was literally smashed during a move and in 3 pieces). I didn't hesitate to replace this album because it's so great. I hope I don't break this one but if I do, I'll replace it again.
POSITIVE	I purchased this book for my husband who is a car fanatic. Everything about the book is good, wonderful color pictures, great descriptions. He enjoyed the book very much and continues to look at it from time to time.
NEGATIVE	I am very well read on the Eastern Front and found this book to be horrible. I would like to save you the time and your money and steer you clear of this awful book. The plot line was plodding and repetitive (e.g. retreats and encirclements, again and again) and the weak details in the art and practice of sniper warfare relegates it to a mediocre military story at best. Most distressing, there are numerous gratuitous descriptions of the torture of soldiers and civilians that does not add to the story. In fact, I believe that I recognize several of them to be recycled from other sources. Also, these examples appear lop-sided and seemingly provided to excuse German actions in this theater in which both sides created and endured barbaric conditions.
POSITIVE	Works exactly as stated, you can also you the cord to connect directly to your PC which give it multiple purposes which is great in any product.
POSITIVE	When comparing Glad bulk count and Seventh Generation bulk count 33 gallon bags, the Seventh Generation costs less per bag. We've been using 100% recycled content bags for eight months, averaging two bags a week, so approximately 64 bags without a single tear or spill.
NEGATIVE	"The subtitle for this mess should read ""a collection of old, dry, and often inaccurate papers that only an ethologist could love."" Seriously, though, this was a waste of paper and ink."
NEGATIVE	The fourth installment ( if you want to call it that ) in the texas chainsaw massacre movies. The first 3 were brilliant horror masterpieces, this one is a joke. I hate to include this or consider this texas chainsaw massacre cause it would be a insult. THis is more of a parady ( a bad one ) of the first 3. Starring Rene Zellweger and Matthew Mcconaughey. Leatherface looked stupid and wasnt scary at all. He dressed up as a woman and wore make up. I know it sounds good but it isnt. The plot sucked, I made the mistake of buying this , I shouldve listened to the other reviewers. This movie is stupid , dont buy it.
NEGATIVE	Donahue's book and its themes have promise, but this has all been done before, such as in William T. Volmann's work on San Francisco or Palahniuk's on Portland--and those writers are engaging without seeming superior to their subjects, while Donahue's writing is often dry and tepid, and rarely infused with either the energy or the involvement his subject requires.
NEGATIVE	"""Absolute Best Of"", ""Best Of The Doors"", ""Doors Box Set"", ""Essential Rarities"", ""Greatest Hits"", ""Thirteen"", ""Very Best Of The Doors""...hum that's at least 7 ""best of"" compilations from a band who only made 6 studio albums with the great Jim Morrison. Absolute ""5"" stars for the music ""-4"" stars for the greed. It figures Blue Oyster Cult & Lynyrd Skynyrd are coming out with another ""best of"" or ""essential"" collection too! When is all this going to end? Oh well it's your $$$$$....."
POSITIVE	"As name suggests ""color paper"" - paper is not colored. It is extremely white. Very smooth, thicker than normal 20lb, and felt very good.Highly recommended."
POSITIVE	The USB convenience is one of the major reasons that I decided on this set. Saving an outlet is a nice feature for a laptop. As far as the sound quality goes, it's pretty good. The sound is much louder than laptop internal speakers. The highs are good, but I find them to be slightly static-y at times with some scratchy distortion (it's mild but noticeable). The mids and bass are average (but a drastic improvement over internal speakers). I find that if you put them on a surface with good resonance, the quality of the bass is improved. They definitely are a great improvement over built in laptop speakers. However, they don't sound as good as a nice 2.1 system of comparable price. This review is for refurbished speakers (but I don't imagine new ones would be any different).
NEGATIVE	This book was not what I was expecting. I can usually read a book within a week and it has been taking forever to get through this one. I don't usually stop reading a book, but I too, would like to just stop reading this one, but am forcing myself to finish it. It took 8 chapters to get to the Blue Dahlia murder...I kept asking myself when this book is going to get going and I'm still asking myself that! I will never read another book by this author!
NEGATIVE	Well if you closely listen to this album you would notice similarities between Fear Factory and this album. So I knew that Slipknot tried to ripoff Fear Factory and they failed. This album tried hard to become death metal, yet the growling was weak, the drumming made no sense at all, the guitarrist are 3 guys that cant pull a decent chord. Practically all the songs sound nearly the same, the same monotone vocal, guitarring and and the same beat. Hell I criticised this album yet I still like their first and third albums, go figure!
NEGATIVE	Strangely written Q&A; style book. I little bit of insight in the beginning, but not a very deep book, nor is it very helpful in practice.Some of the topics in the index sound interesting. They are a disappointment.
POSITIVE	I previously used Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition religiously. A couple of weeks ago, they did not have a word that I was looking for. That's when I decided that it was time for a change.Oxford always had a good reputation for refrence books. I can see why. This book has many more listings. The only thing about this dictionary that I am disappointed with is that it does not have thumb tabs. I find those helpful to have in a dictionary.
POSITIVE	Dr. Oakley presents a book that is comphrensive in nature including research and historical accounts of what is passed down orally in the Eastern Band Tribes. Having lived there for only a bit of time, he recounted some of the same stories that I had heard of Henry B. Lowry. I am soon to teach @ UNC-Pembroke and feel this is a must read for anyone inside and outside the Native American culture in Eastern North Carolina and throughout the Carolinas.
NEGATIVE	This is the WORST apparatus I've come across. DO NOT GET IT. It's cheap plastic. While it may look cool, it is EXTREMELY hard to fit your shuffle into the case; it takes several minutes, and you could end up with splinters. Very poorly designed. The holes for the controls are too small, thus permanently pushing down certain controls. This DAMAGES YOUR SHUFFLE INSTEAD OF PROTECTING.
POSITIVE	This call reaches out and locates that big Tom for you. It does not have your normal box call pitch. It is much higher. I seem to be able to locate some birds when most people have trouble. Anyways would highly recommend. Just don't use it where I hunt............
NEGATIVE	This book is disgusting. I thought the sordid language was beyond the pale.I'm having major trouble finishing it.
POSITIVE	I was looking for a small pressure-cooker to have for a few recipes that required one, and this Presto filled the bill.
POSITIVE	We have been using this book in our Child Development Center for years. I love this book and bought one for my 6 month old Granddaughter (who is red headed like her mom) that lives in Haiti. (Missionaries)The illustrations are as pretty as the writing.
NEGATIVE	This is NOT a live album... it is an unauthorized, low-quality sound board bootleg. Two good reasons not to buy it: (1) the sound quality is fair at best, and often poor, and (2) Ronnie Montrose doesn't earn a dime from it. The money all goes to the thieves who are trying to pass this off as an authorized issue. Buyer beware!
POSITIVE	I have used this unit for 5 years and it works as advertised. I fill it and my cats jus help themselves to food any time they want. Fill and forget until it gets near empty. One small problem is the food if it gets low in container you may have to use youe finger to help fill the frount food area but, it sure beats a food bowl!
POSITIVE	I bought this bag for my 35 year old son for Christmas. He loves it, and uses it for many purposes (overnight bag, lunch bag, etc.)
POSITIVE	I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter and she just loves the display on the ceiling. It is so easy for her to turn on and select the color that she wants displayed and then it stays on for 45 minutes till it turns off.
POSITIVE	I have been using this hair product for years. It works well and I have no desire to look for anything else. Amazon's price was for the large bottle is good.
NEGATIVE	I am a fan of the larger Pigeon books, so I bought this one for my 18 month old who loves books. This was a disappointment as the play on words at the end makes little sense to a baby. This is a waste of money. The longer books are much more enjoyable.
NEGATIVE	Where's Cecil Beaton when you need him. When you have the greatest singers of the last half of the 20th century, Nilsson and Corelli, you don't need all this excess! The Met has toned this production down shortly after this broadcast. This production is so busy I hardly even noticed the singing. You'll find every thing you need on the stage but a basket ball court.
POSITIVE	Devin relates the trails and tribuations of our nations emergency medicalservices in clear and concise manner. This is a good read for rescueprofessionals as well as for the folks these professionals serve each day. Anote to all you young folks out there that are considering a career in thefield of emergency medical service, read the book, it will open eyes as towhat your getting yourself into. If one is active within the service, Devin'sbook will recall ones memories of their own crazy situations. The type ofincidents you thought could never happen to anyone else. If your justinterested in getting a taste of the life, Devin's book will provide anaccurate account of the life style.How do I know this you ask?I've been a fire fighter/paramedic for the past eight years of my life. Ihope this helps and folks, stay safe, stay healthy and stay happy. We rescueworkers would rather meet you in a social setting not as our patient.Enjoy!!...
POSITIVE	This CD is truly one of the better CD's I have heard. To be blunt, DJ Shadow (or Josh Davis) OWNS this type of music. A few others (like DJ Spooky) have come close, but this guy has it all figured out.The CD itself is pure, untainted musical magic. There are phat beats, quiet interludes, and a he|| of a lot of emotions in this CD. I just wish it was longer and had more tracks.The only thing I don't like about this CD is it can be a little obnoxious at times, but after listening to it all the way through, you won't care!Awesome CD from a awesome DJ. A true masterpiece.
NEGATIVE	To be honest, most modern rock bores the tears out of me. So much of it follows the same old tired formula that it is reduced to nothing more than heavy pop. Soundgarden was one band in the genre that always managed to overcome this and caputure my attention. So Audioslave comes along...it sounds like Soungarden minus the latter bands uniqueness, and so it comes of as just another dull mordern rock album...well played, nothing terrible, Chris Cornell's voice is still wonderful...but if I want to listen to Soundgarden I'll listen to Soundgarden, thank you. This must be the year of failed supergroups as Zwan (aka, the new Smashing Pumpkins)'s debut is a likewise decent yet dull modern rock album.
POSITIVE	Heartwarming stories about life among the plain people, full of good quality reading about family values.
NEGATIVE	The vendor sent it poorly packaged and I received it damaged. The return postage was too costly so I kept the item at my expense..
POSITIVE	I remember this story from when I was a child and it's so sweet and full of hope and charm, just like I rememebered.
NEGATIVE	This book starts out okay, but then lapses into the author lecturing the reader about how horrible Europeans are. If you like Europe bashing, this book is for you. Otherwise steer clear.
NEGATIVE	This bodysuit does not do what it claims. Does not hold anything in at all. This was a total waste of nearly $100 because it is not returnable. It is comfortable if you are wanting a liner for your clothing but don't order it if you are wanting any control at all. Wish I had ordered something different.
POSITIVE	"After letting my beasts (Rott and German Shep.) have the option to get on my couch and comfy chairs for the last few years, I really wanted some new furniture. So I bought 2 of the XMat's and a long ""stay off"" mat that beeps really loud when they get on the furniture, to start training for when the new items arrived.I want to tell you that I LOVE the Xmat! The dogs have figured out how to get around the ""stay off"" mat by just pulling it off the couch with their teeth, so in the morning it is laying on the floor. But not the Xmat. They do not go near the chairs. It is just not comfortable for them to lay on. My cat also will not lay on the seat, although she has figured out to jump from the seat to the back of the chair and now lays on the top. I'm ok with that for now, but for the new furniture will probably buy a few more to lay on the top as well. Great product. Great price!"
POSITIVE	Tess Monaghan, newspaper writer turned P.I. is a good read. I think I like it because Tess is real. The reader must make it through her life with her and that is refreshing. Balitmore mresidence should love the book and Lippman obviously does. I didn't enjoy this second book as much as the first one but this series is solid and worth the read. RECOMMENDED
POSITIVE	I used to have a black pair of these and I love them. They really do feel like a tiny marshmallow in your ear. When I found these pink ones I had to have them :3 They came quickly and the transaction was smooth. I highly recommend this product!
NEGATIVE	My first review focused on how inconsistent the delivery was. I have to say that for the past four months, they have not missed a single day of delivery. The Kindle 2 has it by 6 AM most days. Kudos to the people who have been working hard to fix the delivery issues!The only glitch still in the system is that stories sometimes repeat or the headline says one thing and the story is about something else. This happens maybe 2-3 times a week. Other than that, the MN is doing great with the Kindle program. I love reading RoadShow and the different sections and not have to bother with a paper or with recycling.
POSITIVE	I have waited a long time to watch this piece of cinema. It truly is a work of art that is a must for any cinemafile. It made me think of 'It's a Wonderful Life', but you'll have to watch it to see what I mean. Very important.
NEGATIVE	"The ""research"" on the occult issues in this book seemed more like regurgitated blurbs from encyclopedias than actual understanding of the ideas or historical figures involved. The characters were more stereotypes than rounded people, and the book dragged like a bum leg. There was nothing particularly shocking, intriguing, or thought provoking about this book. The part with the demons was really good, but it was over quickly, and it was back to the benign story that meandered forward to an even less exciting ending. This might be good for a young reader, but if you are looking for something well written and exciting, skip it. I couldn't even recommend this for a good weekend read. If you want a good horror book, try S. A. Swiniarski's ""The Flesh, the Blood, and the Fire."" Now, THAT is a good read!"
NEGATIVE	When I was reading this book, it seemed to me that Mary Janice Davidson had some copies of her Undead series and some Bionic Woman screenplays sitting on her desk. What must have happened is that she knocked both of them into an industrial paper shredder, then frantically taped together the resulting pieces and presented them as her latest novel. I love the Undead series, and am passably fond of her werewolf books, but this one was inexcusable. If you feel you must read everything MJD puts out, for the love of God, borrow Hello Gorgeous from someone. Otherwise, you might as well take $14 out of your wallet and throw it out your car window as you speed along the freeway.
POSITIVE	The Amazon price on the notebooks was fine, but getting them delivered was not smoooth or timely. Despite the fact I have a Prime Delivery subsctiption, the notebooks were late and got lost and I did not find Amazon's customer service to be very helpful.
NEGATIVE	This printer would be great if we could use anything other than regular paper in it. It chokes on photo paper. It chokes on anything thicker than regular paper. You end up wasting as much paper and ink as you use on good prints. The rear feed is a joke. You can't even get regular paper to feed straight. Also, as with most inkjets, the ink costs are ridiculous. I'm buying a color laser (maybe QMS magicolor) and will order my photo prints online (it's cheaper and better).
POSITIVE	"I'd give it 4.5 stars, if I could.Love the slim design - I hardly know I'm wearing it. Keeps great time. Looks much more expensive than it is.Con: No light on the watch face making it hard or impossible to read in the dark.I recommend it for a wonderful ""dress-up"" watch."
NEGATIVE	This product was descent for a study manual, but when it arrived it looked as though it had been in someone's car trunck for years.
POSITIVE	This product is awesome. No guess work, just load and go. Paper has removable edges on the sides so you don't smudge prints. Also, the white side is set like a post card so you can easily mail. I took printer and paper pack on vacation and printed my own post cards. Love, Love, Love this item
NEGATIVE	"I'm a huge Suzanne Somers fan, so I naturally ran to the video store when my friend told me that she appears topless, mind you briefly, in her newest film ""No Laughing Matter"". I was gravely mislead. This is all PG 'n stuff. Save your [amt.] for the deluxe ""Step by Step"" dvd boxed set my friend told me they will be releasing in early 2002. SS4ever! Peace out!"
POSITIVE	I got this with Spirit Camera and I have to say that was a nice way to crash course into the series. Seriously, its scary and even though you have a sister near you, its unnerving. Anyway, you'll enjoy this if you are looking for a scary story to play through.
NEGATIVE	"Hey, I really like Mogwai and have been into them for several years since the ""Ten Rapid"" collection came out. One of the better bands operating today in a massive sea of garbage bands that have no reason to exist other than to release a single that sounds like a zillion other bands, make some quick cash and then (thankfully) drift back into the oblivian of working as telemarketers and burgerflippers. Mogwai generally rise above the pack.My Father My King is good. It really is. But I've heard these boys take more extended emotional and sonic journeys in a much briefer space with more musical variation going on to boot.Well, no one bats 1000."
NEGATIVE	Ordinarily I like the stuff R.A.Wilson writes. This time, though, he has written not a book, but a series of 'filler' paragraphs. No subject is studied enough to satisfy and some subjects are left so incomplete I wonder what he was thinking when he wrote it. I would have nuch preferred a book that delved more deeply into several (or more) of the subjects he covered incompletely. A nice try but if I could I would return the book because it was so disappointing.
POSITIVE	"These gems reflect the high points in kd lang's career. Three truly excellent albums, they display lang's songwriting and vocal skills. Not that the rest of her discography doesn't, but ""Absolute Torch And Twang"", ""Ingenue"" and ""All You Can Eat"" will surely attract a less diversified audience, someone who will look for the artist's representative works. Pay extra attention to ""Trail Of Broken Hearts"", ""Constant Craving"" and ""Infinite And Unforeseen"", amongst others. Ideal for those ""who are yet to be converted""."
NEGATIVE	Not what I needed. The product performed as advertised and was a quality product. I am not very happy with this purchase.
NEGATIVE	I am not impressed with this frame. I purchased it as a gift and gave it, but if I had ordered it for myself I probably would have returned it. It does not do a random show, so it will only play the pictures in the order they are saved on the card. Oh well. I own a frame around the same price from a different company that is much better.
POSITIVE	"Holy hell in a hand bag does this album rock! Metallica is back and they mean business. Lars Ulrich has brought in the big guns with double bass in about every song, and you can literally hear Jaymz and Kirk pour their hearts out in their monster riffs that flys like fire through their finger tips. Oh and minus one bass player? Bob Rock stepped up and took care of the bass beautifully. This album shows Metallica going back to their roots, back to the ""Kill em all"" and ""Justice"" days when they were heavier than ever. You can't go wrong with the songs such as St. Anger, Frantic, and Invisible Kid. They are all SO AWESOME!! If you are a Metallica fan then this is the album for you, happy listening Metallica friends!"
POSITIVE	It was a great film, the DVD was sent before I expected it @ my home. I would recommend this film, It's hilarious!
NEGATIVE	Had to purchase it because I needed for graduate studies. This book is obsolete now as the new edition is out. For those of you who have purchased the new APA manual 6th edition, hope you have heard about all of the mistakes in it. Contact APA and the should send you corrections. You can have your copy sent there and they'll send a new one w/o charge.
NEGATIVE	Pillow case are great but the sheets give fuzz balls in the center of the sheets and not smooth not a good buy
NEGATIVE	"Is everybody reviewing the same movie? I've never seen such bad acting. And why did it get an ""R"" rating? There isn't any nudity, and the ""violence"" is a ""PG"" by all standards."
NEGATIVE	I registered for this when I had my son. The metal base broke at the bend from the floor base. I returned it and exchanged it for a new one. 2 years later i had a daughter, put together the replacemnt. she is about 6 mths old, 12 lbs and the replacement broke in the same spot?! and just from my daughter rocking it herself, kicking her feet. Be careful.
POSITIVE	Worked very easy. 4 stars for lack of instructions, but with tips in the reviews to follow the directions of the arrows, i easily figured it out. Took 5 min. Wish I had purchased years ago.
POSITIVE	The Production....Oh my God songs that take you back 11 years ago, I mean by that this is 1994 just like another reviewer said. You would think with the smooth beats that this was an East Coast producer, the songs You can't see and my personal favorite This DJ sets this off with other backup songs to go along with it. Good CD Warren
NEGATIVE	"For the sake of avoiding getting this review tagged as unhelpful, my comments are geared specifically towards ""audiophile""-types who are very concerned with the quality of sound reproduction. If that isn't your thing, feel free to ignore my comments.I really enjoy Coldplay, but the sound quality here is unforgivable. I couldn't bring myself to listen to much of it on my high-end system. For Coldplay fans who are also audio freaks, this album is not for you."
POSITIVE	I have a Brother embroidery machine and love it, so after shopping several sewing shops and retailers, decided to order the Brother online. I couldn't beat the price or reviews. The reviews are right. It arrives threaded w/ color thread to show you how to thread it. I re-threaded the machine and it worked perfect first time. Very easy to thread. I have used it now for a few weeks and my projects look so much more professional! Just love it!
NEGATIVE	"The information contained in this book is all available in the tutorials which come with the program. What's more, it is laid out in such a confusing way that it is next to useless. I'm going to check out Macromedia's *Dreamweaver from the Source* -- I was very impressed with their Freehand guide. As for this book, all I can say is ""read the title ... and save your money."""
POSITIVE	The haunting beauty of this film is something which invites the viewer to watch it again and again and never tire. The neo-realism of the Italian cinema in the 50's is evident, such as 'Miracle in Milan'. However this is not surrealistic, it's poignant, poetry. My family and I watch it regularly, Joseph Cotton gives his best, understated performance.
POSITIVE	After an easy firmware (1.6) upgarde.....this unit is even better.for one....its faster , eliminate the pause or slow start completely!
POSITIVE	"This novel is a shining example of how to make a faery tale fit into our contemporary lives. The spirit is still the same, and the dangers are still as real; but they're brought to a level that the modern person can empathise with. From Snohamish's drug use, to the abuse and mistreatment of Cindy Ellis and Little Hank and Gigi. Even Diego, with his ""Puss and Boots"" storyline is more real and heart wrenching than any ""real crime"" drama."
NEGATIVE	book recieved in a timely manner. Information is OK. Outdated information, lacks specifics. Need better clarification.
NEGATIVE	I haven't been a fan of the wiggles long but now that my 18month old is watching shows we have found this movie, right now its a little old for her and it doesn't keep her attention, the actual show is what she likes and I found this movie to be well kinda annoying and we haven't watched it again i had no idea it was music clips and not the actual show. I have no idea who the wiggle is who is in the yellow? We are use to anthony we were confused and disappointed, maybe in a few months we will try it again.
POSITIVE	I am a Pediatric Occupational Therapist who uses this book during our summer program. We use a different theme every week with the children and during our camping week, I use this to make an obstacle course to go along with the book. First use a holla hop hung from the ceiling with streamers hanging from it for the grass. balance beam over the blue paper to be the river. Half moon rubber like disks to simulate the squelchy mud. Make a forest of trees to stumble trip thru. Use a bubble machine to go thru the whirling snowstorm and at last get to the dark cave they crawl into and find the bear.This is such a fun book both my boys loved when growing up! I continue to love the book and use it as a great sensory motor activity for the children as they venture thru the story themseleves.Melissa Evans
POSITIVE	Great choice of songs. B.J.'s voice is like no other . . . It's as though he is right there singing to you!
POSITIVE	It's the Adventures through Innerspace, Star Trek style. The makers of the series give us a new twist on a classic science fiction story. I dug it, and thought it was well done. If you remotely like Star Trek, you'll appreciate this. 4.5/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'
NEGATIVE	I can't believe how well people rate this movie; it was absolutely horrendous. All the gun battles were ridiculously unrealistic and way overdone. All the characters are shallow and most of the conversation is vapid. The body count in this movie must be several hundred. But what is worse, is that there are these sappy moments with the cheesy music where we're all the sudden supposed to care about the plight of one man after we just watched 100 invalids at the hospital get gunned down.I have to say, I'm really not a big fun of most of the action movies Hollywood pumps out, but they are significantly better than John Woo's Hong Kong flics. I still can't get over why people rate this movie so highly after what I just saw. My faith in humanity is crumbling ....
NEGATIVE	As a writer, Cheryl Harness desperately needs an editor for omissions, unity, logic & coherence. Shock value is found useful on computer games, but injures the understanding and imagines that children need a low thought standard. That is disparaging.
NEGATIVE	It looks good once it's together. However, it scratches very easily during assembly. Also, one of the top moldings was longer than the other two so it did not fit. So of course, while I was trying to get it between the gable moldings, quite a few scratches were made. I have since e-mailed the manufacturer & requested a replacement part. Again, it does look good once assembled once you use the included color marker pen to hide the scratches. But I do not think it is worth the money. Maybe about half that.
POSITIVE	I love this movie. It's a love story with a twist. it's not only about finding and holding on to love, but also about friendships and assisting the ones you love to resolve their lives. it is funny and amazing at the same time. I highly recommend it.
POSITIVE	This book is about bullies that pick on this boy that i a nerd. They push him around, and push his books out of his hands. They realize that they shoild be nice and help the boy, they buy him a new wardrobe, they get his hair cut, they get him contacs. The boys all go to a school dance, and all of the girls are all over the befor geek. Everyone loves this boy now.
POSITIVE	I received this book as a gift from my son. This is now my go to book for vegetables. Without exception, all the recipes I've tried have been wonderful, and it has encouraged me to try vegetables I normally would not have bought (kohlrabi, for one). I couldn't recommend it more highly.
POSITIVE	"I recently went to NYC and decided to visit the Guggenheim Museum. Upon arriving from the subway, I had the unfortunate experience of seeing the entire Museum enclosed in scaffolding. However, I went in anyway and on the way out stopped by the gift shop and looked thru the FLW collection of books and discovered this book for less than $14. I thought the book was mispriced. How could such a beautiful book be so inexpensive in NYC? I had to have it.This book is great for architects or non-architects. It goes thru his entire career without the winded explanations of each of his works. Each surviving work is photographed in color and identified by its original owner with a short highlight of what Wright accomplished. I enjoyed reading this book.My greatest surprise was finding out that part of the Imperial Hotel was reconstructed else ware in Japan before it was demolished. Heinz took ""color"" photographs of it!"
POSITIVE	The Union Square Cafe Cookbook is a keeper. I refer to it frequently for ideas. All the fish dishes are simple and delicious. Mama Romano's Lemon Chicken is a favorite of mine. I like to fix it for the family - it's a wonderful homey dish. It's also good for a casual supper with friends. The cocktail nuts are a staple at my annual Christmas party and everyone always asks what's in them. I've never eaten in the restaurant, but the book makes you feel like a regular. I look forward to cooking out of their new book which just came out.
POSITIVE	Super book about the late John Allen's masterpiece. Many photos in B&W due to time they were taken but a few color shots also. Lots of detail. If you missed any of these stories in MR here is your chance to relive those days.
NEGATIVE	"The ""Real People, Real Sex"" label had been used, very successfully about twenty years ago by a different producer. That series of VHS tapes included a great deal of foreplay in a loving and sophisticated way, with the couples talking and communicating during lovemaking. The Comstock series seems to be about 1/2-2/3 talk, which seems superfluous, then a rather mild and not terribly sophisticated session of sex. I would recommend either Vivid's Sex-Ed series or the Jaiya Red Hot Sex series ahead of this one."
POSITIVE	i'm taking a review course where this book is necessary. it has been helpful. there are example problems and fe style problems with answers. at the back, there's a sample f.e. exam that you can go over and time yourself through. i think it's a good prepatory book if you plan to take the f.e. exam.
NEGATIVE	"I threw away my money on an Equity Insta-Set alarm clock. ""You never have to set it"" - this is only true if you would like your alarm clock to tell you the wrong time. I live in Florida. Right now, it is 4:43 PM and we are on Daylight Savings Time. According to my new Equity Insta-Set clock, it is 6:39 AM, for an error of 10 hours and 4 minutes. If you want your clock to show you a time that is 10 hours and 4 minutes off from the real time, you'll love the Equity Insta-Set.Maybe there is a way to remedy the situation... I can't tell because there is no SET button and the clock didn't come with any instructions.Worthless."
NEGATIVE	"This study guide to the excellent book by Joan Sandin has some constructive activities. However, overall the activities are fairly simplistic, and the references to scripture make much of the ""digging deeper"" activities inappropriate for use in public schools."
NEGATIVE	bought this product at a retail store to use on my boots and hat. Completely soaked my boots and hat with this stuff, used a whole can. It took 4 days to dry and still my feet would get wet in just a few minutes of just walking through wet grass, and my hat, forget it. It shedded water better without it. The water would bead before this stuff, and after I used it, the water would actually SOAK IN!
POSITIVE	"That's how i'd describe this album, plain and simple. How this album is always overlooked (it was only voted 14th in the greatest Irish albums of all time in 2005) simply astounds me. Huge walls of layered guitar, fantastic drumming, effects, samples...brilliant. If every band in the world sounded like Rollerskate Skinny, the world would be a better place.Also buy Dead City Sunbeams by Kid Silver (Ken Griffen) and Kindness by The Radio (Stevie M).I think Ken's in a band now in New York called ""Favourite Sons"". And i'd say they're brilliant too."
POSITIVE	It is awonderful book for kids all ages!! It teaches you alot of things!! I would recommend this book to other people.
POSITIVE	We have this table and its been great! We have it in the dinningroom beside our table...on carpet.She loves to eat at it - if shes ready to eat she goes and sits at the table...the chairs are really light wieght so she has no trouble pulling them out to sit in.The chairs are pretty sturdy to, she has me sit in them all the time and her daddy..lol - I would recommend trying it out -
POSITIVE	A mercenary (Ray Stevenson) leads a team on a mission to protect / accompany a mysterious man to a remote bunker in the middle of eastern europe. Upon securing said bunker, strange things begin happening, growing increasingly bizarre as well as lethal. Everyone already knows that OUTPOST is a nazi-zombie movie. However, this one also has a nice little sci-fi angle, dealing w/ super-soldiers and the third reich's obsession w/ bending / controlling the laws of physics. In atmosphere, OUTPOST is along the lines of an excellent combination of SHOCK WAVES, THE BUNKER, DOG SOLDIERS, and SESSION 9, w/ a twist of DEAD BIRDS tossed in for flavor. Lots of horrific deaths ensue, and the undead nazis are genuinely scary. If you enjoy military horror, zombies, and action, then add this baby to your collection immediately...
POSITIVE	Counting and recognizing numbers adds to fun of putting it together. Three year old walks up and back on the long train puzzle counting, so cute! Started counting backwards, too. And we look for all the zeros, sevens, looking for patterns. Big pieces easy to handle. Also recommend Alphabet version.
POSITIVE	I love it! I get comments on it all the time. If I wear a funny shirt, no one notices because they see the hat! I have to get this in other colors now.
POSITIVE	I have used this distiller almost every day since I got it. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and takes up relatively little counter space. And, the water tastes wonderful!! wish I had gotten it sooner.
POSITIVE	"I found this film very interesting and thought provoking. It is the perfect movie to watch on a dark raining night. Scary and it reminded me of a gothic tale of old. Loved the costumes.It is also a perfect movie for a ""movie"" club, to discuss."
POSITIVE	I enjoyed the story and special effects. Great picture and sound.A children's film for the whole family. In short it is a great buy.
NEGATIVE	I was so excited for this product as I can't sleep if I'm too warm and I love the cold side of a pillow! First of all, I got it and it was nearly impossible to let the air out like they said. Water spilled everywhere. I had 3 people working on it! Sure, it's cool for a little while. But after a few hours of sleep that thing REALLY heats up! I woke up one morning after about 8 sweating profusely because it had gotten so warm. Unbearably hot! It doesn't work...You know what people say about how if it sounds too good to be true it probably is? In this case, it is.
POSITIVE	This one is a film lovers treat! Hip updating of classic film-noir for a modern urban audience, with a sly comic undertone. Cinematically illiterate types will find it flying over their heads, but if you've seen more than a couple of noirs, or if you like mystery and suspense, it's a real winner!
NEGATIVE	"I just happened upon this book in a used bookstore, and started perusing it. Looked at the entries for several people, including Ariana Huffington and Michael Jackson, both of whom she trashes while revealing her apparent jealousy and racist attitude, as evidenced by her description of Michael Jackson's third child, ""a white baby."" I didn't read the rest because it was such a pathetic excuse for journalism or research of any kind.I found the book in the Sociology section of the used book store. Wow, what an insult to sociologists everywhere.Awful, just awful book. I am so surprised that she was married to Tim Russert, who always seemed to be at least thoughtful and well-researched."
NEGATIVE	Maybe people that socialize in a certain circle can appreciate this book more than I can. I didn't even laugh once while reading it. It seems to me that the fabric of a dating scene has to do with who are in it. Can one expect deep relationships to be formed between shallow people? Maybe that's why the author could write up such a book just based on people in her life?
NEGATIVE	I returned the item as it was not the version of the item that I requested.I received the All Zone UK version instead of the US Warner Brother Version.
POSITIVE	I love the Buzz Poets. They are an amazing band. I think this cd is their best. It shows every side of them from punk, to rap, and to general rock. I sugest you buy it. I have seen them a couple times live, and their live shows blow you away. They put on a great show. I also meet them, and they are really nice guys. Everyone check them out. Mad props to the Buzz Poets...
POSITIVE	This yoga DVD is for quite good for those of us who have physical limitations (not just for seniors). Its a great place to get started on yoga practice. Love-It!
POSITIVE	I really enjoyed this book. The author is to be highly commended for keeping a dog who was so destructive and nearly unmanagable. But, what a lovable dog he was. It was a funny book and very sad when Marley aged. I cried when he crossed the Rainbow Bridge.
POSITIVE	"I discovered this book a few years ago by accident on the bargain table of my local bookstore. What a delight! From the first page I was entranced by the concise and clever text, and the joyful, detailed illustrations. Zoom, the cat who loves water (but not to drink...to drink he likes cream) endears the reader to him with his sense of wonder and adventure, and his kindness (even his politeness!). I've given this book as a gift three times since I bought myself a copy, and it's always received rave reviews. I hear it's being reprinted in 2001. Now that I'll be able to find this book again, I'm planning on buying another copy just so I can have framed the illustration of Zoom, leaping for joy as his raft rides the ocean waves, calling back to his new friend Maria, ""More fish!"" ------- More Zoom!"
NEGATIVE	"I got this coffee maker about 9 months ago. Right away it brewed a crummy cup of coffee and soon enough I would put 8 cups of water and get around 5 cups of coffee out. Luckily I have an authorized repair place right down the street from me. They didn't contact me for six weeks after I dropped it off and then one day a new one showed up on my door. ""Great!"" I thought. Wrong. The second one sucked just as bad and after about 5 months of crummy use it really doesn't work at all anymore. Please save yourself the trouble and do not get this hunk of s#!t."
POSITIVE	I've been a huge wrestling fan ever since I was a small child. I've seen every WrestleMania and I can honestly say that this is the best one ever. Everything that was great about WrestleMania for the previous 23 years you can find in this one event. I recommend this event for every wrestling fan, past and present. Standout matches include Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair, Edge vs. Undertaker, and the Money in the Bank Ladder Match. Do yourself a favor and purchase this event. You won't regret it.
POSITIVE	As with all Mr. Myers' books, this is a well written account of supposedly haunted dwellings -- in particular, those of famous folk. He draws no conclusions, which gives his tome an air of journalistic honesty. Very interesting, somewhat spooky in places, and quite entertaining.
NEGATIVE	First of all, this was a phenomenal movie. This review is for the Ultraviolet digital copy. Why are we taking a step backwards? The whole idea behind getting a digital copy is that you own it and can watch it in places without internet access like an airplane on your portable device. Why do we have to stream a video we've supposedly purchased the rights to own? Sorry WB. It's too late for backsies on this one!
POSITIVE	I found this on Amazon and I am eternally grateful. It was a lifesaver for us. It kept track of feeding times, diaper changes, sleeping time, & drugs for mom (i had a c-section). Those first few weeks everyone wants to know when the baby eat, slept, etc last. This does it all for you so you get a break from something additional to do.
NEGATIVE	I can not believe I spent $45 on this 1 disc dvd that only has 3 episodes on it!Talk about a rip off!Think about it before you buy this everyone.It's not worth it.
POSITIVE	this cd is incredible i really enjoy tracks dos and trestelescope eyes is probably the best on the cd. the title track laughing cd is also a triumph...i am listening to tree tops right now... ill float above the ocean...this is some of the sweetest rock ever, but not overdone like some ... bands ...
NEGATIVE	I just got out of the test and was cursing this book the whole time. The information in this book is not even close to sufficient for what you need to know on the exam.
POSITIVE	This book in a wonderful fantasy! Who would have thought how far a community of labratory rats could go? The author does a wonderful job of creating a realistic scene, and while we all know the rats (in real life) are incapable of performing such tasks, he provides a very realistic element. I believe the theme of this book, illustrates a sense of accomplishment, it will show the reader where there is desire, a goal can be accomplished.
NEGATIVE	"Someone recommended this book to me, and I gave it a read, but found that the author was more interested in worshiping physics than in addressing the relationship between the ""new"" physics and God. I was especially disappointed in the mock conversation the author staged. It did not do much to carry his point when the conversations were obviously slanted in a manner to present physicists as totally logical and reasonable, and anyone that believes in God as an emotionally based illogical dolt. Elitism is not very flattering. I found a lot of the author's ""logic"" to have as many holes as the points he just got done knocking holes in himself."
NEGATIVE	Just release the DAMN extended version. You are going to earn A LOT from it so don't dupe us anymore from buying both copies. Just release the DAMN Extended version!
POSITIVE	You know, even the people who claim to hate this movie are writing about it. That alone says something about the movie. If they really hated it, why are they writing? I have seen better movies in my time, and I'm only 12 years old. And yes, in case you're wondering, I'm a girl. But I'm most certainly not one of those Leo-infatuated blockheads.He's not as bad as some people say, though he could use a haircut, and a few more muscles. I admit that the reason that this movie is PG-13 rated seems a little inappropriate for a 1912 setting, but it's a love story, and how many people who are still alive were old enough in 1912 to remember what it was like then?Please don't let the bad reviews phase you. It's good, not great, but it's still a movie everyone should see. I've seen Star Wars: Episode I, and it's a lot better than Titanic. But Titanic is still good.
NEGATIVE	Stop responed in 10 minutes. dont know what's going on. I brought a PNY 7900GS instead and that one works >_<
POSITIVE	"I really love that my grandsons get to watch and love Lucy the way I always did as a child and now,as a adult,i STILL do!An American treasure!These episodes are from ""The lucy Show"",that I loved watching as a child.A great assortment of full episodes,and a few with Vivian Vance,as Aunt Viv.These episodes have Gale Gordon as ""Mr.Mooney,her boss.There a very few in b&W,episodes of when The Lucy show started and have Aunt viv...the majority are color.I love watching these again,and sharing them with my grandsons,the 8 year old is a BIG fan!he loves to come into my room,before time to go to sleep,and put a Lucy dvd in,and we share the laughter together!its a great thing that he would rather watch Lucy than the cable tv!"
POSITIVE	This is a book of joy. The author use of examples and practical experience excellent. I often use this book to keep my focus on what it is to practice mastery in my life.
NEGATIVE	If you don't have anything to do while taking a crap this is a great book. Then just in case you run out of toilet paper you are covered!!
POSITIVE	"A fascinating look at marine animals and how they communicate with each other and with humans. The author is not a biologist and his observations on fish intelligence and other topics would probably be dismissed as ""anecdotal."" But he does cover the latest research as of 1982. A new edition would be a good idea."
POSITIVE	Nothing like the shine of chrome on a 1970 Buick GSX....it may only be 1:18 but it looks like it's 18:18. :)
NEGATIVE	I purchased this kettle based on the reviews I read from amazon and was disappointed to find out no one mentioned how awkward the lid was. You cannot pour water from the kettle without opening the lid or else water will leak from the sides. This means the steam from the kettle will burn your hand. I am returning this kettle and forking over some extra money for a Russell Hobbs that has been tried and tested by me. Its a little bit pricey but my last Russell Hobbs lasted me 10 years.
NEGATIVE	"A friend of mine who happens to be an author (Derek Alexander, ""Brainchild""), and his daughter were reading this book when I came to visit his family. He let me read it. It gave me a headache. There is a 5 page piece about different ways to make eggs. EGGS! Is this a cookbook? Why would that interest me? If you're thinking about buying this, don't, unless you've got pain medicine right next to you."
NEGATIVE	Rothenberg is a New Age writer and musician that enjoys playing music to birds and jamming their singing with the sound from different wind instruments. Surey lots of fun. However, it is from this perspective that he attemps to understand why birds sing. To be true, he does review some scientific papers and provides a not too bad coverage of the findings of the scientific literature. But Rothenberg enjoys exposing the shortcomings of this research (rather pretentiously by the way) and coming up with unscientific ideas of his own based on his feelings about why birds should spend so much time singing. He seriously believes that his empathic method of blowing desceding fifths and chromatic scales with his clarinet to singing birds can take him a long way into understanding the misteries of bird song. Good luck to him.
NEGATIVE	My 2 year old daughter was very excited to play with her new guitar, but as she reached for it while the guitar arm was wiggling, the plastic hinges on the guitar gave her a very bad pinch and black and blue mark! This is not a safe toy.
NEGATIVE	I was disapointed with this sync cord. i cant use it unless the case is off, and it's a pain in the butt to take it off, so i am just not using it. If you order this make sure your case isa very slim case or easy to take on and off.
NEGATIVE	I ordered this battery for a Motorola Razor phone.When the battery finally arrived I installed it in the Razor V3 and the phone screen said INVALID BATTERY.
POSITIVE	I'm a physical therapist who first encountered these packs at a clinic where I worked. I soon discovered these cold packs worked far better than any other I've ever used. They are colder than gel packs and refreeze usually within 30 minutes. The covers provided are extremely convenient! No more searching for a pillow case to protect your skin. And towels are too thick to allow proper cooling of the area. I highly recommend this brand! I have several in my freezer at home for personal use.
POSITIVE	"My mother had four children ""caught"" by a midwife. I was the first born in a hosptal with no doctor in attendance. She always said she should have had me with a midwife. Because of that story from my mother, I wanted to read about midwives. The book is great. What sold me is the fact that the reviews said it rated up there with ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". It is hard to believe that a man wrote it. He had so many insights that only a woman ""should"" know. I have recommended it highly to others. This book does not portray midwives in a bad light. It shows their compassion and love for their patients, as well as the baby. Something you do not always get from a doctor. (Fortunately, I was blessed to have a good OB-GYN.)"
POSITIVE	I have this organizer hanging on the wall right by my baby's playpen. It holds everything I need for her and more. I recommend this product to anyone who needs one place to put everything for their child
POSITIVE	I must admit I'm really surprised at just how great this little stick vacuum is. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it's still too early as I've only had it for a month or so, and things may change quickly considering the amount of use it's been given.We have two seaside vacation rental cottages along with our own home, and have been using this vacuum in all three places at least twice a week.Along with the normal amount of dirt and dust we also have the sand factor to deal with, and so far there has been no problem. I highly recommend this little guy, and in fact may get two more to put into the cottages instead of carting this one all over the place.One suggestion though. Wonder how long it'll be before someone comes up with a combination of corded and cordless model. That way it could be constantly recharging when using it in the electric mode.
POSITIVE	I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. It's an excellent way to pamper your lady. I think she loves it more than she loves me. As long as she's happy...
POSITIVE	I enjoy all the DMB albums and this one is no different. I liked hearing the guys take a different approach and think they hit on some very good material. It's not my favorite DMB album and some of the songs aren't very interesting... but other songs are fantastic and I hold this album as just as 'important' as any other, in its own unique way. It's a strong whole with some real nice songs and a brand new sound.
NEGATIVE	Parmesan cheese demanded a lot of effort. Mozzarela cheese was hard to clean. The molded plastic has a compartment that gets grungy and can't be cleaned. After a year the handle broke off. Why can't someone make a rotary cheese grater that doesn't break?
NEGATIVE	Though I have great respect for Dr. Ellis, he totally blows it with his title. His description of Unconditional Self Acceptance IS self esteem. What he calls USA is what shrinks call self esteem! There is a mistaken definition of esteem based on accomplishment, this is not now and has never been self esteem!!!!! Try the Self-Esteem Game, it proves my point.PS what he calls self esteem I call narcissism. That said, I only disagree with his terminology, not his theory.
NEGATIVE	"This review is for anyone who, like me saw the trailer and said to them selves ""wow that looks like a really cool detective movie"", well its not a detective movie, Mel Gibson is in it as a detective this much is true but his character take a black seat in this picture, wandering in and out of the story line at his will. The real story is about is about two of the crazy people that are staying at this hotel flirting with each other.Milla Jovovich plays her underwritten part well with lots of subtel moments I'm sure people wont pick up on straight away,...Tom Tom character is mentally retarded so its really hard to work out his reasonings and motivation...."
POSITIVE	One of the reasons I like spawn the most is because he is not a wus like superman, and batman. Not to mention those games stunk! But, back to spawn.___Pros___Great graphicstons of origional unlockable contentthe most origional enemies I've ever seengreat gameplay, extreme goreVast selection of guns and weapons___Cons___Story lacking in depthNow stop reading this review and go and buy it now!
POSITIVE	It cuts out at about 20 meters for me. I was hoping the range would be better.
NEGATIVE	It takes three hands to open a can with a Swing-Away can opener. One hand to hold the grip, a second hand to turn the crank, and a third hand to hold the can. This is because the cutting wheel will walk over the rim of the can allowing the can to drop away from the can opener. This might be annoying if you are opening a can of something you can pour out of the can easily, but if you are opening something like chilled cranberry sauce or refried beans, which requires removing both ends of the can and allowing the contents to slide out in a cylindrical shape, this can opener is going to dump the can into the bowl, pot, or whatever food dish you are working over. In a restaurant, that means you dispose of the contaminated pot full of food and start over. So, unless you have three hands, or desire a can opener that requires two people to use, then this particular piece of equipment is not for you.
POSITIVE	very famous black book! This book is not very hard. TCP/IP overview, kerberos5, IIS, DHCP, DNS, WINS, RAS...etc.Special Thanks to nagie, cow, loger! I'm gettabeam!
POSITIVE	"This book is a must-have for anyone even remotely interested in astronomy. Or, even if you don't like astronomy, but you use terms like ""light-years apart"" or ""dark side of the moon,"" you'll find the right answers all here. The author has a lucid, humorous writing style that entertains as it teaches. Popular science at its best!"
POSITIVE	The eighties had to be a hard time for bands, music like everything else was changing and Kiss went right along with that and tried to do something original, and they did it.Fans may not like it, and later they changed back to the original sound, but if you listen to this album, which i like by the way, you hear the influences they had on later to come bands.Some guitar riffs and styles i can hear in later Bowie sounds, also bands like Journey,Boston etc. ,and i can even hear a little of the mid eighties Joan Jett.So while it may have been not to fans liking, it was innovative for what it is.
NEGATIVE	Why does JR Specialties attempt to trick young,gullible, aspiring chefs to use this cheap ARTIFICIAL oil?DO your research- truffle oil is not natural JR, so that piece of info should be included under PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.At least when people pay for the crap you are selling, they should bw aware that it's crap and not someeuropean made high-end truffle oil!
POSITIVE	Used the Canon RS60-E3 with my old Rebel. Now I have the Canon 5D and had to buy a new remote switch for it. The 80N3 is made a lot better than the RS60. The connection is better than the pin type on the RS60. I've use the remote for all my night shots and when I use my 100-400 lens for wild life photography. Canon did a nice job on the Remote.
POSITIVE	This is one of the all-time great showcases for the top actresses of the 1930s. It's written by Claire Booth Luce, and the crackling dialogue & energetic plot are maximized by the direction of George Cukor. Such a good movie.
POSITIVE	"The clarity of Roch's voice send shivers up my spine. He did an outstanding job for this album. You must really listen to the message he is sending in ""Tears in my Coffee"" to truly appreciate the song. ""Myriams Song"" will be a wedding day hit and ""Don't Give Up"" is an inspiration to many. Way to go Roch"
NEGATIVE	This game is slow, boring, lacks tricks, fun and speed. I rather go out and get SARS
POSITIVE	I use this for hair, face, body - it's good anywhere. Nice light oil that soaks into the skin easily, leaving a nice glow. Better than any creamy body lotion that sticks to my body hair. Handy little spray bottle too. I also find it useful in the bedroom for lubrication when/where needed. I'm not crazy about the fragrance, however - it could use an upgrade. -- I squirt a little cologne in the bottle and shake it - that helps.
NEGATIVE	"I honestly don't think the episodes should all be rated individually but I do think that this final episode (or at least the last of the ADV published NGE videos) was terrible! It was probably the worst conclusion to a great anime series that I could have expected. What you see on the cover of the box is about all there is to it inside. Basically the main characters are interviewed and they see what ""could"" have happened as an ending. It was full of ""Everybody hates me!"" being every other sentence out of the character's mouths... and compared to the rest of the series this was just a very poor episode. No real action or even continuation of the story, if Genesis 13 was never published, nobody would even miss it.I'm eagerly awaiting more from Manga Entertainment which is the publisher behind the upcoming Neon Genesis Evangelion: The Movie..."
NEGATIVE	Bought this for my 11 week old scottie, she just started barking everywhere I sprayed it! She went mad! Barks at the puppy mat, turns around and pees on the floor. Waste of money, might keep it incase she starts to chew something, then spray it on that!!
NEGATIVE	Good reading and not too sensational. Could have been more informational though on her life after divorceNot a historical save.
POSITIVE	"i love this album b/c it sounds so ""unprofessional"" it kinda sounds live and has a little bit of a bluesy touch to it its great and ""movin' out"" and ""dream on"" are on it which i believe are some of their best songs!"
POSITIVE	Enya, with her collaborators, is a trinity, and by doing less on this album, they have done more. By holding back on the production, Enya has released a masterpiece. Her choir technique of singing many parts is also more restrained, allowing the songs themselves to breathe in a new way. If this is a dry day for Enya, may she have more of them.
NEGATIVE	Personally and speaking only for myself, it's all very well made, he knows his little tweaks and fiddles by now, and I'm sure his guest musicians were all on his wavelength. But by gawd, what a crashing bore - there seems to be no sense of emotion here, just lovely little droning ditties to package the new-found emotional centering in. It seems like Sylvian keeps getting more and more interested in making perfect little soundscapes as a means to an end, instead of using the 'scapes as a means for connection to a listener. It is terribly dissapointing from the person who (helped) craft(ed) pieces like Blackwater, Heartbeat, the whole Beehive album, etc. He's turned into the Steely Dan of the Eno set.
POSITIVE	One of the best things about Peter Tremayne's Sister Fidelma mysteries are the well-drawn plots. This installment certainly lives up to expectations. Valley of the Shadow is a book steeped in Irish history and the different opposing religious and ideological factions that existed in that era. The author combines a deeply textured and fascinating background with multi-dimensional characters and a fast-paced, twisting plot in which you can't guess the solution to the mystery until the very end. I especially found the historical background very interesting. Tremayne has obviously done a great deal of research for this book. I greatly enjoyed reading Valley of the Shadow, and I suggest it as a wonderful read for any history buff or mystery enthusiast out there- and even if you are neither, I think you will find this novel intriguing.
POSITIVE	"Very cool! I'll bet on a 60+ inch LCD and a Blu-Ray disc, this would be as good or better than actually being at the concert. Ranks up there with ""Mad Dogs & Englishmen"" as one of the greatest concert videos released."
POSITIVE	Just as described. Quick Shipping! I have a Hoover Tempo upright. The bags fit perfect and this is a big discount over retail. I would definitely recommend this!
NEGATIVE	The fact that Mattel has changed the head size and shape is not really apparent from the Amazon pictures, but obvious when the package is in hand. This seems to be true of all 2005 issue dolls but not those marketed in 2004 (such as Princess and the Pauper). The new bigger heads don't seem to be a problem for my 6 and 3 year olds, but I don't think these dolls are as pretty as the original size/shape. (...) The 2004 Barbie Rapunzel comes with a small stuffed dragon instead of the tea party set. FYI: this seems to apply to all 2005 issued Barbies. These dolls are just not as pretty as those we had before.
POSITIVE	As the child of Polish Holocaust survivors, I read Sara's Children with a great deal of personal interest. The author succeeds in faithfully recreating Polish Jewish life prior to World War II, including the gap between tradition and the encroaching secular modernity of a changing world. We all know all too well the ensuing horrors Nazi Germany inflicted upon Europe's Jews. The mutual help the Garfinkel siblings extended to one another, often risking their own lives, was essential and inspiring. If you read only one book about the Holocaust, I heartily recommend Sara's Children, Suzan Hagstrom's well-crafted memorial record.
NEGATIVE	I hate returning items - because I was too dumb to read and trust the reviews but, this bad product makes me think twice before ordering from Amazon again. Amazon betrayed a trust by selling this product with this many negitive reviews. So I was wrong to trust that amazon cares about it's customers and stock owners. Fooled me once! Please forgive me for being harsh, Amazon is mostly responsible. A Amazon buyer needs to be fired over this prodct choice. I bet hunderds of Amazon loyal customers have been lost over this oversight.Buyer beware!!!
NEGATIVE	This item doesn't work in the Chevrolet Tracker 2001 4 cyl 2.0l, like Amazon advertised here, so, don't waste your time if you have that vehicle. It fits, but doesn't work, because it has a diferent operation.
NEGATIVE	Blender did what it was supposed to do, that is, blend fruit into shakes, for about 6 months of use. I was happy.Blender comes with 2 caps for the base - a small screw on tap and a spout. The spout is difficult to clean and adds little benefit so I used the screw on cap. After about 6 months the cap cracked from normal wear and tear and smoothie maker began leak into the base and on the counter top. I reverted to using the spout cap and this cracked after 3--that's right 3--uses. I resorted back to using the small cap wrapped in a towel for about 2 months. Then yesterday during blending the base started to smoke as the bottom part of the blade ground into the smoothie base it is attached to. Plastic splintered everywhere and now I have no smoothie.If a good blender for you is 6 months worth of use, buy this blender. Otherwise I suggest reading reviews of this blender and other blenders from this manufacturer - you will see a common theme. I wish I had...
POSITIVE	This book and the studies within are a hugely NEEDED wakeup call for our society. We changed our diet last year to a mostly plant based diet and I cannot even begin to tell you all the amazing benefits we've seen thus far. Additionally, my mother in law works in a hospital who has recently implemented the CHIP program, which was also founded by the author of this book. A very smart man trying his hardest to honestly change this country's horrible eating habits. This book was just one of many that contributed to our family's nutritional education. Highly recommended for anyone who puts food in their mouths, especially mothers responsible for feeding children.
NEGATIVE	Have spend several hours trying to make this work reliably (surprisingly, with a Linksys WAP4400N access point). It performs way too badly to cost this much.1) Version shipped is 3.1. Linksys' web site does not even list version 3.1 firmware. Last firmware release is for 3.0, back in 2007.2) The configuration utility allows choice of WPA2. It does not work. only WPA/TKIP does work.3) Don't bother with the CDROM. It did not detect the directly-attached bridge. Just use the Web-base configuration tool.4) Even when it connected to my access point, it drops lots of packets. And loses connection after a few hours and has to be power-cycled.This product just is not worth the hassle - look elsewhere. Returning product to Amazon as basically defective.
NEGATIVE	I was very dissatisfied with the products that were sent to me. Though I appreciated the customer service from the seller I was disappointed that this blue tooth did not connect with any of my cell phones. I have returned this product back to seller via Priority Mail from the USPS.
POSITIVE	I am a long-time subscriber to InStyle magazine and one of my favorite sections is the party theme article at the end. The authors need to write another book with even more party ideas!!
POSITIVE	I loved three's company since I was a child. Thank you amazon for bringing back my childhood happiness.
POSITIVE	Evil Dead Regeneration picks up where the movie left off. Bruce Campbell returns as Ash, but this time he gets a sidekick that is voice by Ted Raimi. I've been a big Evil Dead fan for probably twenty years, so I had to hunt down this game when it first came out because I couldn't find it in the stores. This was my first horror game that I have played and it is one my favorites to play despite a few minor game glitches. There is over-the-top blood and gore that should satisfy most horror fans.
NEGATIVE	"Just another Anti-Confederate liberal college professor who has as grudge against anything Confederate. His verbal wars with the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Arkansas evidently predicated this book. As the author of a regimental history of a Federal Regiment and a Federal Reenactor, he has collected some essays from other liberal or pro black, pro Federal ""authors and/or historians"" to advance his agenda of Racist Confederate Troops massacring Black Federal Soldiers and Civilian.When you look at 19th Century History through 21st Century eyes and attempt to judge just to advance your own political agenda you are doing a disservice to your readers. His description of anyone Pro-Confederate or Pro-Southern as ""Neo-Confederate"" is proof enough for me. I guess this is a new term now used to identify someone who is proud of their Southern and Confederate Herigtate and makes no excuses for it."
POSITIVE	"Roy Harper is an Englishman whose songs are a celebration of life itself. Stormcock is the best intoduction to this great artist's work. The provocative intensity of his lyrics(in the spirit of Bob Dylan)combined with the matching drive of his performance(""The Same Old Rock"", and the beautiful love song ""Me And My Woman,"") makes Stormcock an album that grows richer with the passage of time, and each listening will reveal some new facet to the listener. This album is pure poetic magic."
POSITIVE	"The album's excellent. Jaco on ""In France They Kiss on Main Street"" is worth the price of admission, all by himself. God really must be a boogie man."
NEGATIVE	"This author should stick to Sports Illustrated or switch to Mad magazine. His style is that of a gossiping school girl. It would have been an interesting project for an author that has studied film or knew what he was writting about. How can someone write on a topic that they do not know? Bamberger, you risked your so called ""career"" on a topic that you obviously did not do your homework on. The next time you meet a celebrity at a party they will think twice when asked by you to follow them around for a year."
NEGATIVE	If the Bible is to you just a collection of stories then doubtless you'll find this interesting. But if you do believe in God and in Christ then you will find these texts horribly offensive and blasphemous. In particulaur the Infancy Gospel, which portrays Jesus as a spoiled brat with supernatural powers. Contrary to the review below, NO Bible writer quoted from these books. If God inspired these texts, He would have assured their inclusion in the Bible. Don't read these myths and fables; study the prophetic Word of God!
POSITIVE	"I turned on the radio to Oldies 99.7 KFRC because I love the Beatles, and the station was playing Christmas songs nonstop. I sat down to eat breakfast when I thought that ""When I'm 64"" was starting, but then I heard ""You better watch out, you better not cry..."" in a voice that sounded exactly like Paul [McCartney]! After the song was over, the DJ said that it was the Fab Four. Over the next few weeks, I heard ""Let It Snow"" and it sounded like ""Eight Days A Week"" and ""Jingle Bells"" which sounded like ""Tomorrow Never Knows""! They are FAB-ulous!"
NEGATIVE	A melange of mumbo-jumbo that is esentially unwatchable and unbearably boring. Adds little or nothing to our understanding of the Unabomber or the emergence of the internet. In addition, this film does not provide captions or subtitles when English is spoken, and this may be a major deterrent for viewers who rely on them.
POSITIVE	I really felt the difference with this bag with the details. Heavy duty zippers that are smooth which surprisingly is tough to get right by others.Useful side pockets and a well padded back. Great fit of the shoulder straps. I'd recommend it if you want a bag that has a lot of room.
POSITIVE	What they said!I'm not normally a fan of history, but this set is well worth it. Fascinating, accurate. Watch one episode and you'll be hooked. It's that good.
NEGATIVE	"washed item and first used about two days later. Did a nice job of steaming; however, I noticed a smell which carried over to the food. I have not used since but will try again as it is quick and easy - just need to address the smell issue - if product takes time to ""air out"" and smell issue is resolved 4 stars. If smell issue remains 0 stars."
NEGATIVE	ALL THIS MOVIES SENSUAL COUPLES MASSAGE NEVER BUY ! NEVER! It is the worst quality for Blu-ray, it is home made video an is like on VHS not blu-ray! Music terrible! Boring Boring Boring! It is even not sensual massage!!!! I return it!!! The worst ever!
NEGATIVE	For Bette Midler fans, this project is just like any other Midler project. So they would enjoy it just the same.But for Rosemary Clooney fans like me, its a complete dissappointment. Choosing the Rosemary Clooney Songbook for this album is totally wrong, since the late Miss Clooney was the queen of songbooks herself...
POSITIVE	This is one of the saddest anime movies I have ever seen. I love the Tenchi series and this film solidifies my appriciation for the series. This is a must see for all anime fans.
NEGATIVE	These are great in principle. They're roomy and easy to use. But, they fall off! Just ask my laptop that went flying down the street. On the other hand, the Targus slip case that it was in inside the panier protected it beautifully!
POSITIVE	The recording of Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason was fantastic. I laughed so hard I was practically crying. My life demands that I spend lots of time in my car. The book on tape was a terrific way to enjoy commuting. My favorite character is Bridget's boss. The audio does a terrific portrayal of the characters. I thoroughly recommend this sequel to anyone who can really laugh at themselves!
POSITIVE	the songs are off the hook...they voices are kewl...the lyrics are tyte...the whole CD is good...this CD is worth buying...it's time for asian groups and singers to be heard
NEGATIVE	The lap attachment would have been incredibly useful if the base (the part that you squeeze between your legs) would have been longer. It seems like it would be better suited for a child. If you are over 6' tall and weigh over 200 lbs., you probably would be better off trying to clamp your Driving Force wheel to a table.I sincerely hope that Logitech redesigns the next lap attachment with full-grown adults in mind.
NEGATIVE	If you have read Kevin Anderson's first X-files novels , you will be utterly disappointed by this trash!
POSITIVE	What can you say? It's Heath Ledger's last work before his death. That should be worth the price of admission alone. If not stay to watch a beautiful movie. The movie is a wild ride of Dr Parnassusian psychedelic bliss! Enjoy!
NEGATIVE	"Although mine is only a 512, I, too, have suffered from the mysterious sandisk cruzer death. I'd only had my 512 titanium for four months, and--literally--only used it about 8 times before the disk stopped dead in its tracks and my computer could no longer ""recognize"" it.I, too, am being forced through hoops by the Sandisk customer service/tech people. Although I've done their ""suggested reformat"" steps TWICE (although it's a bit hard to re-format a dead device ;-) and told them so, some clueless tech named Kirk keeps writing back, urging me to do the same pointless rigamarole over and over and over again.Frankly, if they do not tell me where to send this pathetic piece of merchandise for a FULL REPLACEMENT soon, I'll have to wash my hands of this company (but, you can be sure I'll tell my story far and wide).Beware."
POSITIVE	"I purchased this book titled ""The Genesis Record"" by Henry Morris due to recommendation by fellow bible teachers as an excellent source of commentary regarding the most controversial book of the bible. My was I amazed at the intense Spirit filled reflection of the book of Genesis by Henry Morris. Although he has gone home to be with the Lord, Mr. Morris has left behind a treasure trove of in-depth information that will aid any serious student of the book of Genesis especially needed in this age where there is rare good expository bible teaching found.Sincerely,George H. Mitchler"
NEGATIVE	A friend has a double walled stainless cup that keeps ice frozen for hours. This one doesn't. I was very disappointed with that.
POSITIVE	I love reading about the founding fathers. this book written by Jefferson and not by a surrogate was very enlightiening
POSITIVE	I first obtained this Bible on a lone from a dear friend. I was doing research on the Holy Spirit and wanted more information. This Bible is the King James version and contains many extra study notes. Including many word translations from the original Greek and Hebrew text. I couldn't put it down. I had to have my own..... If you are looking for a wonderful study Bible, you will not be disappointed. Much Love to all, Vicky Reid West
NEGATIVE	"I thought this would smell alot diferent -- and better -- than what this product actually smells like. Cocoa bliss? Anybody would expect based on that name for it to smell somewhat like cocoa: chocolate-like. It doesn't. It smells (weakly) like white peach, and the ""cocoa"" is a reference to the scentless cocoa butter moisturizer the spray has.This is not a terrible product or a terrible scent, but it's not something I would have knowingly purchased either had I known what it smelled like."
NEGATIVE	The lynksis router was expensive and is now malfunctioning. The repair instructions don't work. I can't connect to internet wirelessly, despite strong cable signal. Lynksis support says that I have to pay $$ for advice to fix it since it out of warrnty and there is no free live chat avaialble. I am ticked.
POSITIVE	This is a nice family movie.Good casting, good fictional adventure, it could show kids small kindness can change lives.Only problem was some unanswered questions.Good movie for your collection.
NEGATIVE	this book is full of outdated and contradictory information. makes me wonder if they did any of their homework. they lump butter and margarine together and treat it as one food. on page 18 alcohol protects the brain from dementia, on page 27 it accelerates the progression of alzheimer's disease (just one of many contradictions). save your money
POSITIVE	Faster Pussycat industrial style? Not exactly...Taime proves he is multi-talented and lyrically superb with the self-titled c.d. Very simaliar to NIN yet the Newlydeads stands in a class by himself. If the Self-titled Newlydeads c.d. is any indication of where Taime is moving lyrically and musically - his future looks bright. It's not exactly Faster Pussycat (I loved them) but the Newlydeads Smokes!!
POSITIVE	I love all of Tracey Mallett's workouts, and this one is just as great as the rest!!Get Your Body Back is an excellent circuit-style workout that will help you burn fat & build muscle...and get your body back!! LOVE that the workouts are broken down into smaller segments for those super busy days, too!!This DVD is a great compliment to her Quickblast DVDs. While her Quickblast workouts are a little more cardio-intensive, Get Your Body Back will help you obtain more muscle definition while still burning fat!!TRY IT!! You won't regret it!!
POSITIVE	Iwas happy with transaction. I had to contact the seller and was answered quickly which was very nice. Good job I would definitely buy from them again.
NEGATIVE	How sad is this game> Probably the best platformer on the Playstation is now the worst on the PS2. Worse than the 5-year old original technically and it doesn't play as well and full of glitches. ...
POSITIVE	If you can get past the scholarly anthropological mumbo jumbo this book is great for those interested in the Aymara people and their evangelization.
NEGATIVE	I purchased this so that I could insert my XD card into my printer. The compact flash adapter wouldn't work with my Canon Pixma all in one.
NEGATIVE	Camile Velasco, Matt Rogers, Jon Peter Lewis, John Stevens, Jasmine Trias and Diana DeGarmo suck. Their voices are so terrible and flat, especially Camile Velasco's.On the other hand, Fantasia, Jennifer Hudson, Amy Adams, George Huff, Leah LaBelle and La Toya London had great voices. Just go listen to their AI songs, so you won't have to buy this worthless album.
NEGATIVE	IBM viavoice usbpro has major conflict issues with mcafee internet security suite(6.)Ibm redirects you to scansoft that has a lousy support which is charged to your credit card after the first free query;their online knowledge database is sparse and the tech personell seem to be reading their answers from algorhythms with background knowledge barely above the average customer's; Mcafee has a more extensive online database but no free tech support phone calls; problems of conflict between the softwares were related to TCP/IP port (viavoice apparently works through an open port) and to speech engine conflicts;none could resolve these issues;such issues in my opinion can only be resolved by interdisciplinary programmers;short of this the choice is one software verses the other
POSITIVE	This game is fun. You get an extra life stage, and can play sims that you wouldn't have been able to play before!Don't let your sim slack off tho or they won't graduate and will be kicked out of Uni!! :)
NEGATIVE	While creating a backup, it destroyed my disk. This is the worst behavior I can imagine.Creating the backup, it froze. Then, it would not boot Windows. Ghost had put its own boot blocks on the disk, build another partition, wrote itself into that partition, and would not boot windows. You could boot to Ghost, but it would just freeze or fail in booting windows.In the end, I had to format and rebuild the disk ...(Windows repair did not work. The system would not boot after repair, and repair did extensive damage.)
NEGATIVE	I would not recommend this game. Too much work for the younger kids. I do not think it taught better financing to my kids. Every turn the player has to collect their salary and then pay what they owe. Kind of boring. Also too much work for the banker. The banker has to be constantly giving out money. If I were you I would not spend 30.00 dollars for this game. :(
POSITIVE	If you are looking for information and solid reading on the AKC Bull Terrier then this is the book for you! As a long time breeder, this is finally a book I can recommend for novices interested in the breed. The book is also enjoyable for us that have been in the breed for a while too. The book includes color pictures of well known dogs in the breed along with some history. I have purchased this book several times over for gifts.
POSITIVE	I am not a mother, but am a vet student and use this thermometer to get fast, accurate rectal temperatures on cats and dogs. I imagine that a mad cat and a baby would equally apprecaite this product. I have double checked the readings I get against the standard ones our hospital uses and the readings have been within 0.1 degrees; so I consider it pretty accurate.
POSITIVE	I didn't know what to expect with this DVD. From the title, I gathered it was topically oriented around religion. From the author/presenter (Julia Sweeney), I gathered that it would involve comedy. What it turned out to be was a masterful tale- a smart, entertaining, thought provoking and often funny tale. In this tale, Julia happens to lose beliefs and gain knowledge. The performance is riveting. She uses all of her comic and storytelling skills to keep the viewer fully engaged. I had to listen to every word just to make sure I didn't miss another subtle bit of genius.I will likely watch this multiple times and I fully recommend it for anyone with an open mind and an appreciation of a well told story.
POSITIVE	i absolutely loved this book i couldn't put it down, its 372 pages and i read it in two days,it always kept me on my toes, and wanting more, although i thought the description of white was very typical, the only interesting thing about his features was a tin mask, and well lets face it the mask is a little played out in the horror stories, other than that it was an awesome book, and i recomend any one who likes horror stories of evil versus good to read it.
NEGATIVE	Ugh! This book was a gift, so of course I read it. Don't waste your time! I read it a year ago and it still sticks in my head as one of the worst books I have read in quite some time.
POSITIVE	They have done it again! I really liked this cd! To me they are like a fine wine, they get better with age! I hope they continue to put out execellent cd's like this one! Some say the Bee Gees are a thing of the past, I think they should hear the future!
POSITIVE	This video is an amazing look at the intricacy of our planet and it's place in the universe and how intelligence must be needed to allow for something as unique as our home in this hostile and diverse universe.
NEGATIVE	It looks like it would be a cool bulb but it didnt fit in my Honda. Its bigger than the bulb it replaces.
POSITIVE	"In my opinion, Gena Rowlands is ""Gloria"". She should have won best actress for this one. It is the type of movie you can view over and over again and never be bored. The little boy who was cast as ""Phil"" was wonderful in his role as the orphaned lost boy. Everyone who was cast in this film was made for their part. I ordered the film as a welcome addition to my collection of great movies. Don't miss this one. LynnMarie"
NEGATIVE	It doesn't work, unless you do it on YOURSELF. That is a shocker! The fly lived in the wires for a while and flew away. I smashed a few with it, literally, but that is it!
POSITIVE	I got this and two other games for the kids (age 6 and 3) for Christmas and they were so excited! Their dad opened the boxes and they started playing each of them. This one all three of them truly enjoyed. There was a lot of very happy yet loud noises at each turn.
POSITIVE	Ironically, after having been in the fireplace business for several years, I do not have a fireplace in my home. I have missed not being able to stoke up a fire on a cold and damp day. The Ultimate Fireplace DVD has been an amazing replacement for the real thing. My wife and I are voracious readers so we curl up in our favorite chairs nightly with our latest books in front of the crackling fire. We have two dogs and it is funny how they start to pant when the fireplace DVD is running. It is so realistic that they are sure they must be getting hot. With Christmas around the corner we put on our favorite Christmas music and the Christmas fireplace scene and our home takes on an idyllic presence with us curled up with a steaming cup of tea or hot cider and the dogs resting beside us. Truly a Rockwell moment.
NEGATIVE	This story was painfully boring. But I trudged through it because I figured it had to get better. I was wrong. From beginning to end, the plot is shallow, the characters boring and uninspired, the storyline so linear, and the dialog so completely unrealistic, that this book will probably disgust you for wasting your time to read it. I, for one, was glad when it was over.
NEGATIVE	I searched high and low for this Shell Shocker for my 8-year-old grandson. He played with it in the house yesterday (Christmas). This morning my daughter called to tell me that the gear had broken. Seth was using it outside for a few minutes, and the gear broke. What a disappointment! I would not recommend this toy.
POSITIVE	It is one the best foundations I have ever used..esspecially during summer time..but as I travl overseas and the security restrictions apply I have to put them in to my luggages and when the time comes to use them they become messy..please find another way..
POSITIVE	"This book was written with much careful thought and planning. It shows that even a man of God can go through trials and tribulations and come out as pure gold. I wish that everyone would read this book so that we can have power from God to forgive. Roman 12:21 says ""Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."" I'm glad that I read the book. It showed me that no matter what I go through, I should forgive. It helped me to learn that the person you love the most can hurt you, but to forgive them and move on. God has ordered John's steps with His Word. He will be blessed abundantly."
POSITIVE	I was so happy to find this movie on Amazon, because it is hard to find (even though it's the best muppet christmas movie ever!) Would recommend giving it a try if you haven't seen it, it's the perfect christmas movie for the whole family!
POSITIVE	I really fell in love with these the moment I saw them. I have really weird feet, and with a blister stick, and some strategically placed dr scholls cushy shoes things, have made the shoe quite comfortable. The heel is very walkable and sturdy. Fryes whole line has been quite interesting the past few seasons!
NEGATIVE	When consider a title, the audienced and projected population should be considered. This book fails both.I read a lot of computer books, since I work on networks and I wouldn't want to do anything else for a living. I hope the authors have something other to do than writing, since they do it so very poorly. The book is badly titled and terribly written. After an hour's struggle I set it aside. It rambles and presents topics such that retention is all but impossible. Simply put, Hacking Exposed has nothing to do with hacking, cracking and everything to do with the boring diatribes of those big on theorectical security and lean on practice. Deep discounts are definately in order.
POSITIVE	"I purchased the Tractor for my grandson....the look on his face when he saw it was priceless!I wanted one that was a minture of the ""John Deere"" Tractor his Daddy uses on the yard.It was just that a perfect duplicate..."
NEGATIVE	NOTHING I CAN ADD TO WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID. THE BOOK WAS TOO OUTRE, FRAGMENTED. I COULD NOT FOLLOW ANY LINE AS EVERYTHING KEPT GOING BACK AND FORTH FROM ONE FLASHBACK TO ANOTHER. THE CRIMES WERE WAY BEYOND REALITY.LOUSY WASTE OF MY MONEY.
NEGATIVE	I purchased this based upon the fact that it was for high pile carpet, but my chair still sinks into my carpet and when I move my chair, it goes right back to where it was before.
POSITIVE	"Watching the Metamorphosis of Brian Warner into Marilyn Manson, and The Anti-Christ (one face, anyway) is an experience well worth viewing. When I watched this, my opinion of the DVD was ""ok,"" but in context and after thinking about the other VHS and DVD materials available I must recommend this.My perception of this DVD was created, at first, as a comparison with Marilyn Manson's live performances, videos, etc. However, this DVD gives us the raw footage of his transformation, and considering his budget (or lack thereof) he did one hell of a job putting on a real SHOW.This is the gritty, raw, early years material....before the elaborate concerts and massive props. Watching him ""make do"" with what he had available is fascinating, and the more you think about his stage sets the more you can appreciate his brilliance. Marilyn Manson could turn a garage sale into a stage set. He is certainly a real showman."
POSITIVE	I did my homework and learned from others misfortunes. This product is great! The customer service is prompt, friendly, and very helpful. I am going to purchase another now that I am sure it works a wonderful as everyone else said it did. No other after market product is a cleaner or easier installation than this unit. Thanks Satechi for an excellent product.
NEGATIVE	it's the worst book ever !!!oh wate i totllay mean it's sooo goood i'd buy it if i were you!!!
POSITIVE	"I've used this machine several times and have not been disappointed. The instruction book is clear and concise (I love concise) and so far, the machine has performed exactly as promised. Set-up time was minimal and the machine is easier to thread and much ""smoother"" and less noisy than those I have used in the past. Additionally, the machine comes with an accessory kit that includes everything you need to get started AND extra needles.Very pleased with this purchase."
POSITIVE	i cannot say enough good things about this film. it is simply perfect. glenn carter is absolutely riveting -- his gethsemane gives me chills every time. what a voice!! i can't get it out of my head. but the entire cast is excellent, down to the chorus. staging is paced just right, and costumes and sets updated for the new millenium -- will appeal to every generation. my 3 kids have it practically memorized. if you've never seen this show, get this tape. it has it all.
POSITIVE	"Even with a virtual army of professionals and hundreds of volumes of Christian books carefully analyzing our emotional health, many of us still wrestle with deep, unresolved hurts, often still feeling overpowering needs to be loved, accepted and secure. Why? This book will teach you how to effectively apply what you believe to how you live. Here is a courageously articulated plan for bridging the application gap between intellectual belief and heartfelt conviction. Includes case studies of real people caught in conflict, lively anecdotes from the author's own experiences, and pertinent Scripture references. Get off the ""perfectionist"" treadmill & experience the feeling of being truly accepted. It will help you see how a proper understanding of just who God is, can lovingly transform all your relationships, and how to get rid of fear and anxiety about the future. This book is easily readable and clearly structured."
NEGATIVE	Not a 'cover' at all. Just a cheap piece of plastic that has to be tied onto chair and then doesn't fit correctly. Worth less than a dollar. Total scam.
POSITIVE	"If you are a Jean Shepherd fan, you will also be a FAN of this dealer. I ordered this product for my husband for Christmas 2012 and it arrived 'quicker than Santa'. Perfect condition and all for a GREAT PRICE! Jean Shepherd would be proud. ""See, you still can purchase something in this country for a great price with quick delivery."" Hope your Christmas was as happy as my husband's.Marianne Laird-BirdNutley, NJ"
NEGATIVE	"Ok, for starters this movie is in now way accurate. Titanic was fictional as in they added fictional characters but this just totally changed what actually happened. I was anticipating the most brutal slaying of Heather Grahm's character Mary at the end and when I saw what they did I was like ""What the hell?"" You'll see what I mean if you watch it. And Jack the Ripper wasn't caught and nobody knows who he is. Johnny Depp is his usual best but even he can't save this weak film. Heather Grahm should just stick to doing comedies, she's good at that but not at this. Good atmosphere is the only good part of this movie"
NEGATIVE	awful, full of plot holes and forced-dialogue to explain things so you dont feel completely lost. AWFUL movie and i absolutely LOVED the previous Batmans
NEGATIVE	please read the description carefully,,,,this is not made out of wood but made out of resin in china....it is heavy enough but not hand sculpted or even scuplted at all.....for that reason i am dissappointed...I am not sure why they put driftwood in the name of this product but for that reason i feel deceived and dissappointed....this product is not what i was expecting at all....
POSITIVE	"The Oginski's style is very similar to the Chopin's. Well, they were both Polish and created in the same era. However I think I even prefer Oginski. I only wish that CD encluded the most famous Oginski's Polonaise: ""Farewell to the Fatherland"" (""Pozegnanie z Ojczyzna"")."
NEGATIVE	Bad lightening, bad audio, I can barely watch this without getting really angry for buying this! I would NOT recommended this DVD!
NEGATIVE	My grandchildren age 5 and 3 cried with this story and wanted the book out of the house because they were so afraid...I always review the books I purchase for them and this had a good review...however, the child is the real test and this was a return...
NEGATIVE	Boy what a rip-off! 12 half-hour episodes, totaling less than 6 hours, half of a normal television season, for $122!!!!This is even worse than the original $150 Paramount had charged for the Star Trek DVD seasons, those were complete 25 hour long episodes.Save your money & buy these affordable Peanuts decade sets:Peanuts: 1960's Collection (A Charlie Brown Christmas / Charlie Brown's All-Stars / It's the Great Pumpkin / You're in Love / He's Your Dog / It Was a Short Summer)Peanuts: 1970's Collection, Vol. 1 (It's a Mystery Charlie Brown / Play It Again / A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving / It's the Easter Beagle / There's No Time for Love / You're Not Elected)Peanuts: 1970's Collection, Vol. 2 (Be My Valentine Charlie Brown / You're a Good Sport / It's Arbor Day / What a Nightmare / It's Your First Kiss / You're the Greatest)
POSITIVE	Cables are as advertised. The seller even worked with me when I wanted to order and additional cable and have everything shipped in one shipment. Would buy again and work this seller.
POSITIVE	"At least the 80's were good for something - this is written with real fervor, with the kind of intellectual panache that is all the greater for seeming to have been ignored. Neumann's work in this slim volume needs to be read by every would-be leftist, and then worried about over morning coffee. Social theory as ""useless"" - enduring brilliance that needs no updating, since western political culture seems frozen since the Neumann-derided sixties. Of course, no one is going to pay 45.00 for a 1988 paperback, so this review is self-congratulation, though the good professor deserved the Left Nobel for this youthful work."
POSITIVE	This game is the best out there! Better then planetside, because you dont have to pay month by month for a great game. The detail is breathtaking, the maps are just massive, the game is just awsome. And it dosnt require much either.
POSITIVE	The 1928 Book of Common Prayer is a treasure that helps maintain my spiritual life. The book reminds me to take time in the morning and evening and talk to God. Although this book is a treasure for Anglicans and Episcopalians, anyone who would like guidance in prayer and Christian celebration throughout the year will want this book to be their constant companion.The book is bound very well and the type is easy to read. It's a bit large to tote around but perfect for reading in a relaxed, cozy home environment.Mark P.
NEGATIVE	"I give this book 5 millstones! Mark 9:42 ""And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea."" These are the words of Jesus! If you are a Christian and don't believe Jesus' word then you are a hypocrite. Quotes from the Bible that are used to support child beating are from the Old Testament. Jesus was against it. You should be too if you are a TRUE Christian!"
POSITIVE	Very well made cap. Gave it as a gift for a bald friend and he is still wearing it two years later!
POSITIVE	Using this cable in a whole house audio system. Clean cuts, thick jacketing with tight stranding. Great deal for the price. Will purchase more when needed.
POSITIVE	THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I CAN SAY I WAS EXCITED TO PURCHASE A METALLICA ALBUM AND EVEN MORE NOW THAT I HAVE. NO MORE MAINSTREAM GARBAGE, BACK TO THE REAL THING.
POSITIVE	I was a little disapointed of the somngs on the CD but besides that I'm no complainer.
POSITIVE	So many things good here:One of the TRULY great films and hardly anyone even knows about it. My highest recommendation for this edition or the original. For this edition:1) A package so much better than the original release.2) Bonus material above and beyond the original release.Still worth getting if you have the original release - I have MULTIPLE copies of BOTH.
NEGATIVE	These are NOT foldable UST (tubeless) Tires. They are solid rubber, heavy, piece of crap tires that should be sold for $.25 cents a piece. It took me a long time to get my money back on them, as they are nothing close to what is advertised, and they are still advertising them! In my book, that is fraud, as I have made amazon and Nashbar both aware of the problem. DO NOT BUY THESE!
NEGATIVE	So far I've found the more common Schalge locks for the home are not on even a reasonable end of cylinder designs. This one comes with a manual for JD60/JD62 but the rekey manual from Schlage does not reflect this lock for these model numbers. This lock uses a very cheap looks to be one time use retainer for the tailpiece forcing you to forget a follower and just reinsert top springs and pins on the way back together. I'm no expert but there is a much nicer design for this I've seen on other Schlages. Very dissappointed in this product considering the brand.
NEGATIVE	"My rating refers to the quality of the item delivered, not the content of the textbook itself, read on for details.I ordered this book through Amazon.com, LLC hoping to avoid the many low quality counterfeit textbooks shipped by many third party sellers. When I opened the box, the packing slip said ""Principles of Fluid Mechanics, [Hardcover]"" but the textbook was just what I wanted to avoid. The cover was flimsy paper, the entire content of the textbook was printed in black and white on what looked like extremely cheap recycled paper.I thought it had to be an error, so I called Amazon and requested an exchange. Lo and behold, the replacement item was the exact same low quality item. I ended up paying $50 LESS to get an actual hardcover from a third party seller on the site. I hope Amazon.com, LLC will look into their supplier and fix the issue soon. Until then, they are charging $150 for a product that is NOT as described."
NEGATIVE	I agree with those reviewers that believe that this is not Agathat's best work, far from it. Her foray is mystery and this books attempts to be a thriller, which doesn't work at all. I cannot say that the writing is bad but this entire book is just not interesting. Her other books that have to do with world organizations are much better although also couldn't be compared to her regular setting of a family murder. So much of the plot just doesn't make sense and apart from the three main characters everyone else remain hazy, which is never the case in any of her other books. I have the entire collection and must say that this is her most unsuccessful literary attempt.
POSITIVE	this tape is great, my son who is 2 has low tone, especially his core, so the therapist recommneded Kinesio Tape for his trunk (tape an X across his belly)...it is safe and he is totally fine with it...also easy to use.
POSITIVE	Everything you ever wanted to know about long distance shooting,but wouldn't live long enougth to gain the experience yourself. Topics from wind speed est. to types of cover,rifle types compsite stock vs wood. Barrel length, scope alingement
POSITIVE	"I was late to the Uncle Tupelo party, even though I lived around St. Louis at the time. Much like Gram Parsons before, Uncle Tupelo seem to have gotten more recognition after the fact than they did while together. Both artists are credited with pioneering this so called alt-country scene, though ""UT"" include elements of punk as well. This anthology of theirs may be imperfect, but it's still the perfect place to start your collection of the group or genre. Included is ""No Depression"", ""Whisky Bottle"", ""Moonshiner"", and a live ""We've Been Had"". Plus a decent cover of The Stooges ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"". At 21 tracks, this disc is a good example of quantity, as well as quality. If you like this, you might also like Wilco, Son Volt or The Jayhawks."
POSITIVE	I can say worked well for what i wanted. It connects to my TV and lap top. I also have it on my computer.
POSITIVE	Works in accordance with literature. Fittings need to be wound with plumbers tape to achieve a decent non dripping seal.
POSITIVE	I love this brand of polish- its what my nail salon uses. Great long-lasting nail color!! I would recommend this brand in any color.
POSITIVE	The music behind the brilliant lyrics has progessively gotten cleaner. Now it sounds so close to perfection that MTX must be peaking.
NEGATIVE	"""Col Mike Martin"" raised in Iraq, speaks fluent arabic.........The Taliban are Pashtoon, they are not arabs, they don't speak arabic, they don't even like arabs very much. They are a totaly closed tribal society. I spent a year living and working with the Pashtoon in 2005 in Helmand Province. There are no members of the Taliban who are not Pashtoon. The other ethnic groups in Afghanistan, the Tajik and the Hazara, are opposed to the Taliban.Mike Martin would not have the correct family, clan and tribal ties and background to carry this off.Sorry, but Forsythe has dropped the ball on this one."
NEGATIVE	The author sets up an interesting source of conflict: magicians that can exercise their magic only by sacrificing someone they love -- the greater the love, the more powerful the magic they can then wield. Everything else about the book sucks; the characterizations are shallow, none of the characters are particularly likeable, and the plot meanders pointlessly. What a waste of time (and trees).
POSITIVE	THIS BUGGY IS SO CUTE, WE GOT IT FOR OUR NIECE WHOS 8MONTHS OLD SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVES HER NEW CAR. IT HAS A SEATBELT FOR SAFTY REASONS WHICH IS GREAT WHEN USING WITH SMALLER CHILDREN THAN DIRECTED. ITS BEING USED INDOORS NOW AND WILL BE TAKEN OUTSIDE WHEN THE WEATHER PERMITS. THE SMILE ON HER FACE WHEN YOU BEEP THAT HORN IS PRICELESS. GREAT TOY!
POSITIVE	Yet another great read by Brenda Novak. I Love the Dundee, Idaho books...all of them are great, not one disappointed! I love how characters from the other books mix in and we can hear about them again!
NEGATIVE	Lordy. I remember watching this when I was a kid and then I saw it on TV again a few weeks ago. There were really, really hokey special effects that I could spot when I was a child. There were weird actors. The Meteor/Deep Impact/Armageddon story line make this a depressing visitation to a time when science fiction was still looked at as Sunday pulp. Somehow with all this, this Green Slime gets on one of the Astronauts, and then grows into a bunch of what looks like kids in bad alien costumes with big red eyes. If I can remember properly, this crud was produced and filmed in Japan with American actors, and it was completed quickly to try to beat 2001 to theatres. Cripes, I can still see the poor Japanese children draped in foam rubber with tentacles a danglin, getting shot by weird white dudes. I can't really recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen it when they were a kid.
POSITIVE	I lost a previous one, I missed it so much, I bought this as a replacement. It is great for quick fixes that require a screwdriver. Knifes are sharp and strong. Too bad it is not allowed with carry-on on an airplane
POSITIVE	This novel made me an Iris Johanson fan! What I love about her works are her strong characters, particularly the heroines. Marianna is a strong, intelligent, creative young woman, who is not the victim of The Beloved Scoundrel, but the champion of the story. Her wit and her passion endear her not only to the handsome hero, but to the readers as well. Bravo, Ms. Johanson!
NEGATIVE	The story is very weak and the attraction between the characters totally avoid of any believable base. I disliked both the female and the male characters because they are too lame and poorly shaped.
POSITIVE	I got this book in Kilkenny for 4.99 Irish Punts, about the same as the North American price. Although there are only twenty-seven songs in this little volume, some of them are not to be found elsewhere. I have especially enjoyed playing the arrangements of Follow Me Up To Carlow and The Parting Glass in this book. The words to the song The Lark In The Morning herein are different from those of the singing of Paddy Tunny, a further illustration of the vigor and variation to be found in true folk music.
POSITIVE	This is a lot more shallow than I thought it would be but it is still a great little sand box. Perfect for decks, porches, small backyards. Or just when you want to have something up and off the ground. Also, the cover is perfect and the holes that caused the issues before (in previous reviews) have now been sealed up so it doesn't leak.
NEGATIVE	This book provided good information, but too many laws have changed concerning personal finance and debt problems. Look for the 2008 version of this book and other good books from nolo and other sources on debt, money troubles, personal finances, consumer law, etc.
NEGATIVE	yo compré el estuche según la sugerencia de Amazon, sin embargo es muy pequeño para el nuvi 260w.
POSITIVE	In this book you can see that the solution for treating depression is not in a prescription... I'm going to try and find a doctor here that practices what this book is all about. They say that you might get depression symptoms from some food, from things in the environment, deficiency of minerals, etc. That is what needs to be found out and treated and when it is, your depression will go away. The book makes a LOT of sense. PLEASE READ IT, you won't be sorry.
POSITIVE	I didn't even like country music when I purchased the LP back in the sixties. I'm not sure what prompted me, I guess I figured that if the Byrds did it, it must be okay. I had no idea the album would blow me and my friends totally away. This is an every song is a winner album and an album that was instrumental in my adding country music to my ever widening musical tastes.
NEGATIVE	Sorry Ms. Rice, but i couldn't. It seemed too paranoid. I also had the same problem with Violin. It's like you lost it for the first chapter and therefore, i lost interest.
POSITIVE	Truly fantastic.I gave four stars only because the beginning half moved a bit slowly although important and interesting.The second half of the documentary is truly captivating.
NEGATIVE	I only have one question: Why would White Supremecists be trying to blow up San Diego in the first place, and don't you think they would get more guys on it than an aging detective and a dog? What were the other cops doing, were they all on border patrol? Wouldn't it have made more sense to use an ethnic actor SOMEWHERE in the film about white supremecists? No, this movie instead shows you that an old white cop and a canine can solve racism and stop terrorists. Nothing about this picture was believeable. This is one of the worst movies ever made, all-time. I told my kids that they could never see it again, I don't want to damage them further. Skip it.
POSITIVE	Fi Youm Wi Leilah is one of the best that Warda has ever sung. The composer, Mohamed Abed El Wahab, was so proud of this song, and he worked on it for more than two years. The result is a song that would never be forgotten. Since Warda sang Fi Youm Wi Leilah, this song has become part of the Arab memory, and Warda has turned her name to a legend. Don't miss this opportunity, and get the CD which will give you the best idea on the high quality of Arabic music, and the melody that you will never forget.
NEGATIVE	DO NOT BUY THIS PRESSURE COOKER!!!!The lid and body of this pressure cooker are nice. However, the screws that are used to attach the handles to the lid and body are not shiny stainless steel but black paint coated.. These screws became very rusty after 2 uses. The color of the screws is BROWN now, no longer black paint coated....
POSITIVE	I don't purchase many DVDs as I soon get tired of them. Not this one. When I tire of TV I watch Toby Keith's biography, or his movies over and over. The biography does a good job of covering his life from beginning to the present. I would have liked more personal interviews of him. Too bad we don't see more of him on TV. We need more patriotic citizens like Toby Keith. He stands up for what, and whom, he thinks is best for our country, not for the party.
NEGATIVE	"The ""Brothers Bloom"" has a great cast and fine acting.It has lush, amazingly varied scenery--St. Petersburg, Prague, Mexico, Montenegro, Japan, etc.It has decent direction.But it doesn't work. The problem is the writing. The movie can't decide whether to be a Romantic Comedy, a Romantic Tragedy, a Caper movie, a Rival Brothers movie, a Character Study, or any of several other things.It ends up trying to do all these things, and doing them all badly.Throwing in quirky characters helps, but only temporarily.Ultimately, the movie lacks energy. Lacks tension. Lacks conflict. Lacks suspense. Lacks coherence.It has lots of ideas, lots of (paper-thin) plot, lots of beauty, even lots of interesting lines, but none of these work together.Pity.It is no accident that by far the most interesting character is Bang Bang--who has no lines.Without a coherent script, no movie can succeed."
NEGATIVE	I have loved using the Palm Z22 for a number of years. When my old one died, I thought I could replace it with a used one. Wrong! This one is so old that it won't let me enter a date later than 2010 - so it's basically of no use as a calendar. Very disappointed with it.
NEGATIVE	"I purchased this to listen to at work. When I first plugged it in, I was very happy. This review is on the product, not the service. I have no cmoplaints about XM service, but this reciever must have never been designed to be listened to for more than 45 minutes at a time. I had on that cut on and off all the time, and I thought it was defective. I received a new one, and the same thign. It is as if the receiver overheats and shuts itself off. After about 1/2 an hour of ""rest"" it will come back on, but beware, only for about an hour. This product is great if you will be in and out of your car, and you do not intend to use it for more than an hour a day. Otherwise, stay clear...nothing but a headache!"
NEGATIVE	"PLEASE buy ""Michael Moore Is a Big Fat Stupid White Man"" instead of this book and skip ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" Yes, Moore makes some humorous points about where liberals (and conservatives) have gone wrong, and yes, if he means this book to be a total assault weapon against Bush, he succeeds. But his total disregard for his audience's intelligence and his endless whining about being booed by the Hollywood amoral Brain Trust spoil any good in this book.Although Mr. Moore is entitled to his opinion and the last time I checked, this is a free country, Mr. Moore is an intellectual coward who got trounced by Bill O'Reilly AND uber-left Vanity Fair critic Christopher Hitchens. Not only that, according to reports, Mr. Union refused to pay the writers on his show ""TV Nation"" WGA minimums. (RADAR Magazine, premiere issue.) Dude, where's your integrity?"
NEGATIVE	So, you have a date with the wife. While she's looking good, your becoming infuriated and looking stupid while pulling this pump that ultimately doesn't do a thing.If you're lucky enough to get a vacuum,(the only way to tell is to release the vacuum and listen for the sound)half the time you pump and pump and get no vacuum at all. If you bump the top even slightly while putting the bottle back in the fridge, you lose the vacuum and have to start all over again. I say save the money and drink the entire bottle, you'll both be happy you did.
POSITIVE	Released in early-2000 on the TDI Music label, Edgar and Jerome Froese produced 11 interesting tracks for this motion picture soundtrack. Obviously with Eastern musical influences, the soundscape is mostly meditative, but there is some clubland sparks that smoothly slides into the mix.The elegant Cradle of Prodigies is the standout selection, though the bouncy Meng Tien, along with Zhu Zhanji and Tiger Forest are highly expressive. There is a majestic ambience that flows throughout and it is a solid, stand-alone artistic work.
NEGATIVE	I just opened this comic book and it's completely moronic. I'm stunned by how stupid it is. In the first few pages, an overachieving Bible College student murders his dean because one of his professors tells him that the KJV isn't the inspired word of God.I mean.. it would be funny if it wasn't so pathetic
NEGATIVE	It was not very comfortable. It didn't look the way I thought it would. I regret buying it
POSITIVE	This is an extremely useful overview of African life and how slavery disrupted so much. The important take-away from this work is that Africans were often equal actors in this history -- not only victims.
NEGATIVE	"The trouble with most successful artists, and Springsteen ranks with the best, is that they fall into a belief that they can impose upon their fan base just about anything on the basis of them being ""creative"". This self-indulgent album lets Springsteen down badly and apart from diehard American country fans, won't rate elsewhere. Were I have to have one front tooth and a jug, I might find some joy in it, but I don't and I didn't. Next!"
POSITIVE	"This DVD reflects the joy & delight I get from Clapton's creation.I have only three words to say ""BUY IT NOW...""GilIsrael"
NEGATIVE	First the cup is top heavy.The real problem is it takes for ever to get hot.I thought it was so you set the heat and would be done. No-- you have to keep pushing a button to the heat you want, but when it reaches say lukewarm and you want hot it resets itself to lukwarm, then you have to push again to reset again and again to get to hot. Not to good while driving in LA traffic..I just made a 250 mile trip in my car and my cup never went more than lukewarm but one time to Hot. Problem is I stopped to gas up and it reset itself to Room Temp. Finally threw out the coffee and bought a cup togo..
NEGATIVE	I would like to give you a good review, but I havn't received all what I orderd, only half the order came, it was going to be shipped in 5 or 7 days that was 3 weeks ago. Can you tell me what happen to it???????????????????????????????????????????
POSITIVE	Uncommon Carriers is an uncommon book, but then that is what one should expect from John McPhee. This is the third of his books that I have read, and all have been rather quirky. In Uncommon Carriers, McPhee investigates the behind-the-scenes world of transportation. He does this, not by doing research, but by actually participating in the transportation activities. The up side to this is that the reader gets an inside view of the often hidden world and an appreciation of the complexity that surrounds ways of life that may seem rather blasé to those not in the industry. The down side is that McPhee sometimes gets so deep into the vocabulary of the industry that he loses the reader. Because of this, some of the segments are more accessible than others. But all are fascinating and eye-opening.
POSITIVE	I was an adolescent when I saw THE FUGITIVE the first time, and I was captured by the charachter of Doctor Richard Kimble, and all his troubles that are quite conspicuos even for a man on the run! And now to ricapture that atmosphere again is simply amazing! not to speak of lieutenant Gerard and his obsession, of course....
NEGATIVE	This record does nothing for any of these stellar artists. It's stale. Nor does it contribute to the soul music cannon. Or any cannon. Hey.. I've got an idea, lets get a bunch of great artists, bang a few tunes on them that they wouldn't normally sing, keep the recording production down. I'm sorry...I like every one involved with this record but we don't need this. It's like a bad sitcom staring great actors. The tracks are all pedestrian. I do not endorse this record.
NEGATIVE	This juicer worked good at first, but broke and was completely unusable after three weeks of normal use. I peeled oranges and limes. I always cut fruit into smaller pieces and was careful never to force anything into it. The electric motor in this particular juicer is very weak, and wears out quickly. It's a cheap made in china pos. I juiced daily with it and like I said, I took care never to overload it and it still wore out.
POSITIVE	"I was excited, yet skeptical when I opened this book. Ireceived it at work, and as I opened it in front of my bossan a co-worker, I thought to myself, ""this cover lookspretty thought provoking..I hope they don't think I'm somekind of weirdo."" Well, Brodie's book is exactly about these""responses"" to memetic programming. If you are at allinterested in questions about why we think the things wedo, and how much of what we think is programmed rather thanconscious decision, then you'll want to read this book.Not only does it get you thinking, it gets you to gettingothers thinking. Whether you (or they) like it or not!The book is itself a ""Virus of the Mind."" (evil laugh...)"
POSITIVE	I think this book is a all right type of book. I know life has its struggles, but there is nothing worth running away from. I believe it was a couldn't keep the book down group, but I believe nothing is worth running away from.
POSITIVE	My 10-month-old daughter loves this book, and so do I. The cloth pockets that allow you to place the little, stuffed Snowbear (attached to the book with a ribbon, of course) in the different scenarios are ingenious. Skye will sit on the floor with this book for long periods of time playing with Snowbear, and squeals with delight when we read the story together. One of my favorite things about the Bear In The Big Blue House board book series is that pictures of the actual characters are placed in colorful environments, which facilitate recognition. Skye and I both give it 5 stars.
NEGATIVE	I found this to be a very boring, almost make you crazy CD. I wish I would have paid more attention and got something different.
POSITIVE	Loved going back to the 80's even if it was only for a while.............my Japanese husband loved the 80's music as well.
POSITIVE	this is a great product! the wireless is great especially when just want to use the mouse on my leg when my arm hurts. I have noticed a problem with the mouse and games. The mouse tends to not work so greatg with the Simsand a few other games in which it sometimes doesnt move, but if you just minimize the game and change channels it tends to work again. Thats my only complaint with this product
POSITIVE	Chuck is a serial format TV show - the shows must be watched in series in order to follow the story line and character development. If you haven't seen the series, start at season one, episode one, and work your way forward.
POSITIVE	I heard of this being the best selling album of all time, after I bought it on Amazon I believe it was! Like every song had a great beat and bass, talking about you just gotta get up and dance. Most of your favorite songs are on here, like Billie Jean, Beat It, Thriller, and of course mine... Human Nature. I am telling you, this is a pretty good price, I am super super happy that I own it! On the dvd they have two of his music videos Billie Jean and then Thriller. And the peformance that he done with Mowtown, you know when he first did the moonwalk thing. If I were you I would get it! Done deal! ;-D
NEGATIVE	I rarely write reviews, but this book had me so annoyed I had to let people know. For some reason, this book seems to be popular amongst 'preppers'...and after reading it, I can't figure why that would be. This book has a decent enough plot, but the author seems to want the reader to know how much knowledge he has regarding survival equipment. This becomes ridiculous after the first couple chapters. People just don't talk like the characters in this book, I typed on my HP keyboard while looking at my HP LE1901w monitor. See how annoying that is? That is all throughout this book. If you want a good book that puts 'ordinary' people in a survival scenario - read One Second After - possibly even Lights Out (although not necessarily well written, it is a good plot).Stay away from this book.
POSITIVE	I had watched the other 2 movies of this trilogy, for that reason I couldn't stop to buy this to complete it.If somebody doesn't know this trilogy, I recommend it, it is simply remarkable.
POSITIVE	Tape is easy to use and follow. The two seperate workouts are very good. They are long enough to get a good workout and short enough to squeeze into a busy day.
NEGATIVE	This disc sounds like all the other male CDs out there right now. The songs on here even sound the same.
POSITIVE	I have looked and analised the book, and compared with the Peppin Press books, this book is all you need to learn and study packaging design.This book will teach me and maybe you how we can design packaging.All cash deserved
NEGATIVE	The BANDLAND part of the CD was great.... the usual wonderful sound one expects from Les Brown, but I couldn't say much for the REVOLUTION IN SOUND part. I found the music fading in at the beginning and fading out at the end to be very annoying. I can't see that serves any purpose whatsoever. I had no idea this was done when I sampled the music from the AMAZON site, or I would not have purchased the CD.
POSITIVE	This book was tremendously helpful in helping me understand how our Asian background has shaped us into who we are, and how God can use us to edify His kingdom. It is a good book with many practical insights and personal stories from the writers. I recommend every Asian immigrant reading this book as it is well worth investing the time to read it. It is by far one of the most helpful books I have read. It is also an easy and fun read!
POSITIVE	Marilyn Grall's TAMING THE LION is a very sexy story of a forced marriage between two passionate and strong people. Lionel is the warrior who is order to marry by his lord. Alexandra is the lady. She is young, beautiful, and running wild. In the style of Virginia Henley and Thea Devine, TAMMING THE LION tells the story of a marriage duty, that turns into a passionate marriage of love.
POSITIVE	This is the best USB drive I have purchased. The speed in which it transfers data is excellent and it is very reliable. Hurray for the 1 GB SanDisk USB flash drive.
NEGATIVE	When I saw it, I thought that I was buying something Good, Because it seemed like a good price and good condition , but the thing is that when I recieved this product, I realized that it was not original, It's just a copy..I regreted a lot about having spent my money in this crappy.
POSITIVE	As with every cd made buy podunk this ep rocks from start to finshed its great .Great guitar playing ,great song writting,they production a little scratchy ,but iam not complaing they simply rock.Buy this ep you wont be let down they sound like the black crows but are harder like led zepplin ,you wont be dissapointed
NEGATIVE	The sound is top notch! very good ergonomics.. Ease of use.. battery life is OK.. compact when you need it pit away until this little knob thingy that holds the headphones together and makes a clicking sound to lock itself gave way!! and I couldn't find that little piece!! wtf! Now u can't lock this POS! there goes my 50 bucks.. unless you super glue it permanently for which it defeats the purpose!! shet!
POSITIVE	I was surprised to see this on offer on Amazon, but decided to give it a try. My husband is the caretaker of bonsai trees, and we both admire the beauty of the Japanese maple.What a treat this was! It was packaged carefully, arrived quickly, and has become a mainstay in our home. I would highly recommend that if you see a plant you love via Amazon, order it. It's quick, it's painless, it's wonderfully easy!(We've now had this for over a year!)
NEGATIVE	This one, from an accomplished and popular artist, is a disappointment. He seems caught up more in the harmonics of these tunes -- which are sadly similar to one another -- than he does in the rhythm. The result is clever chord changes without a steady tempo. Most disappointing is the audio quality. It's either his left hand on the frets or his right hand doing the plucking and strumming, but there are ugly squeaks that occur much too often, and it quickly becomes distracting. I'm a huge and steady Pizzarelli fan, of both Bucky and John, so this outing is saddening.
NEGATIVE	I got this for my small 90 gallon pond. This filter is totally inadequate and I was warned by local retail stores and pet stores that it would not be a strong enough. They all said it just doesn't do the job. Well i wish I listened! Take it from me.. DON't BUY IT! Spend the few extra dollars and get a stronger one!
POSITIVE	This was a fantastic concert. I had the chance to see Iron Butterfly on this tour at there concert in Berlin in 1997. This is a good remember of this concert.
POSITIVE	This little book has been around for a while. I wouldn't say I was a die hard Ray Malbrough fan but I can see some practicality in this book. It does have some pretty good basic info on hoodoo and hoodoo spirituality. There is a good chapter toward the end of catholic prayers.
NEGATIVE	I bought this webcam because it was on sale with a microphone. In the future I would rather pay full price for a webcam and a microphone, because both are basic and do not have any special features. This webcam produces a very dark picture, even after I have adjusted all of the settings. However, if you want a basic webcam it works well because you can at least see who you are talking to.
POSITIVE	This game is great for all ages. It's a fun,action packed game. It's pretty challenging as well. Buy it,and you will not regret it.
NEGATIVE	"The device works as it is supposed to. I like being able to control my TV, Cable box/DVR and DVD player with only one remote. The big problem is the size of the buttons that control playback of a DVD, DVR are TOO SMALL. It is almost impossible to hit the ""Play"" button without hitting ""Pause"" at the same time. (NB: I have fairly small hands for a man.) Trying to enter channel numbers is a chore. The button are all flush with each other. Raised buttons would have been more sensible. Raised, lighted buttons would have been even better. So, I'm stuck with the damned device because I was careless about evaluating it. Don't make the same mistake."
POSITIVE	I bought two of these for gag gifts this year and both people loved them. I laughed out loud multiple times.( we played the cd 3 times during xmas ). Really low brow humor but well done. basically just various bodily noises along with various xmas / holiday songs. No vocals.
NEGATIVE	WHAT IS THIS?Oh man...what a piece of trash.They should have stopped after the very first one.I swear, if I could go out and grab every singlecopy of this HUGE disappointment from the shelvesof every video store and mall- I would!This one should have sank in the mud with that horse from part one.
NEGATIVE	The ring is too thick with the friction cover. Many of my items to be hung can't be fit onto it.
POSITIVE	I love Gerard Butler. The film is less cheesy than the stage opera, which is good. It's a great version and I highly recommend it.
NEGATIVE	Do Not Buy this is you have Windows 7!!!I ordered this for my daughters to play on the computer, so I don't have to sit for hours and play monopoly. It doesn't work with windows 7 and froze the computer multiply times. Also, the CD is required to play the game, so only one of my girls could play the game at a time.I am very disappointed with this product and wish that it was stated somewhere that it is outdated and can not be used on newer computers.
NEGATIVE	trying to get the download to work, and so far it's just a painthe episode itself would be great - I've seen it on my tivoI just haven't bothered to watch it online - I'm interested in building a library I can use when wifi is not available
POSITIVE	This is a fun fast read but the mystery is not easy to solve . I find it tough to. Think of Cora Fenton without thinking of a chain smoking and drink guzzling. Maxine. It is worth the bucks. Buy it! Only four stars because this is not Shakespeare
POSITIVE	Tom Knauff is acknowledged as leading instructor and has written a very good book. It leads you through an entire flight training plan to solo with an emphasis on safety and decision making. However, it is meant to be used in conjuction with your actual flight training so be sure to discuss using this book with your flight instructor. There is an updated (1995?) edition.
NEGATIVE	I bought this book in the interest of getting a sense of the work of some of the writers that Rosenbaum includes in his cast; I finished GOLEMS hoping that the rambling would led to a satisfying end. Neither of these ideas panned out. Reading Andrine's review, I was so relieved to read that someone agreed that book just didn't do anything interesting with its material.Also, based on the little research I've done on the topic and the other, better books I've read that include them, Rosenbaum's golems aren't even golems. What's going on with that? A much better book that includes the concept and some satisfying background information on its history is Marge Piercy's Body of Glass (published in the States as He, She, and It).
POSITIVE	This is not only a great book but also a engaging CD, and listening to the audio versions of her poems tends to make me emotional every time. When you begin to go through such poem as Daddy's Song and listen to it on the CD which features her actual father on the track, I guarantee you can't help but to cry. You can see a performance of it on youtube but it really is a distinctly different version, unfortunately excluding her Father.
NEGATIVE	"Garbage! UTG bipods are manufactured to the lowest standards! These have no business being mounted on a weapon, perhaps an airsoft gun or BB gun. These bipods are manufactured in CHINA and their customer service is routed through CHINA as well! UTG bipods utilize cheap hardware and consequently torque under minimal stress. The bipod I received twists about the yaw axis when simply folding and unfolding the bipod's spring assisted legs. I called the customer service number provided on the packaging and my call was routed to CHINA!!! The customer service representative ""CSR"" spoke broken English and was unable to resolve my issue, at the end of my call this ""CSR"" directed me to their website...Don't purchase this bipod!!! You will be disappointed!"
POSITIVE	Thank you for such a great shredder. It works perfectly and now I do not have the paranoia with tossing my bills out. Cuts through paper quickly and not as loud as others I've seen. I would highly recommend this stylish shredder!
NEGATIVE	This much I'll say, at least Ryan Cabrerra can write his own songs and is a musician. But thats where the compliments end. Unless he was prevented by his label for some reason from releasing his better songs, then maybe that could excuse it. Stick to the underground, Fiona Apple, Nirvana, Corinna Fugate and accept no less! Nirvana, come back around, we need you, Kurt!
POSITIVE	This album is pure pop! Every song is so catchy that a person who likes Heavy Metal will actually sing to this. Almost as good as Twice Removed! SLOAN ROCKS!!!!
NEGATIVE	I bought this thinking I was going to get a rain shower effect. No way. It seems to have very little water pressure and it clogs up. The worst problem is that it sprays my ceiling and my contractor has tried and tried to stop it, but it just won't stop. I'm glad I bought a handheld at the same time or I would never get the soap off. I'm getting a new showerhead after a few years of putting up with this. It isn't a Danze.
NEGATIVE	I bought this sewing machine and have had problems with it jamming over and over again. Bringing it back and trying again.
NEGATIVE	I am so dissapointed with this piece. If you cook meat, it is very easily get stick. I think the stick layer is too thin so that it does not work very well.DO NOT BUY IT.
NEGATIVE	I thought that the romance between the two main characters was cute, but this book was so boring! The accuracy from this time was awesome, but all the talk of the stone carving almost made me fall asleep. The writing was fine, the characters well written, but I like books with more humor or action in them. This was a snooze for me.
POSITIVE	Ever notice that the tv shows that are entertaining always seem to be the ones to bite the bullet? Reaper was such a show. A fun diversion from the mainstream cookie cutter garbage that seems to dominate tv. Ray Wise has always been a very under rated actor who constantly delivers memorable performances (Robocop & Twin Peaks stand out) and his protrayal of the Devil was fun. RIP Reaper.
POSITIVE	"I read this book years ago and have recommended it to my colleagues and employees. The book clarifies the path from dependence to interdependence, a path many people do not fully understand. I have been a CEO for the past 20 years and have never been one to settle for second best. I agree with Covey's statement ""the enemy of the best is the good"" and was delighted to follow his recommendation to Optimal Thinking. We are now implementing the 7 Habits and Optimal Thinking throughout our organization."
POSITIVE	I've always really liked WCW's poetry. I found this a fascinating autobiography. He was a rounded man with a real doctoring job and a wide range of friends and experiences. The autobiography flows very smoothly and easily and gives you good insight into the times. This was to me a momentous period in the history of poetry, imagine all these folks Williams, Pound sitting around in the early 20th century, smoking, jawing, it's almost unreal and Williams gives a good picture of it...and also how you can be a poet with a real job (as hardworking physician) as opposed to faculty at Harvard. An easy read and a good one.
POSITIVE	This is the first Perry Mason mystery I've ever read. If you liked the television series, you'll find all the same characters in this book. It's a good mystery and moves swiftly. It reads a bit too much like a script, however. There's almost no attention to scenery. The reader is given almost no information of what the characters think and feel.
NEGATIVE	very disappointing. most of these are remakes, not the originals. I know as I at one time had the records, which I bought the hard way, one 45 rpm at a time. Laine always had great background support via the Columbia studios which is definitely missing. The Woman in Love does not do her thing with the Moonlight Gambler.
POSITIVE	I found the original version of Firebird in a used bookstore over a decade ago. I have to confess, I initially bought it because I liked the cover! But then something strange happened when I tried to read it -- I couldn't put the book down. I was so caught up in the tale of Firebird and Brennen that I read it from cover to cover in almost 1 sitting.I was not disappointed with the new version. All of the characters that I liked so much were intact, and given extra dimensions to their personalities. I plan to read Fusion Fire (the sequel) as soon as possible.
NEGATIVE	This is a ripoff, you should buy Shonen Jump! Read Yu-Gi-Oh! Millenium World instead its alot better.
NEGATIVE	I tried this for a few days and its way too fast paced... then i tried jillian michaels and it was much easier. I am a little overweight and p90x is very hard. Dont waste your money....find another product btw you also dont have to buy there equipment u can get it at walmart. I personally dont like the YOGA on here I am not bendie. its LONG too about 60 minutes. I would say pass on it if u can. I also want to say i have a shin spint and lower back problems this would not be the DVD for you if you have any problems like that
NEGATIVE	"If the purpose for purchasing this book is to wean you child in the least troumatic way, for whatever reason, do not bother. You will only learn how not to wean. But if you don't really have to wean, you might feel stronger about continueing nursing. After 25 months of nursing I have so many reasons to wean I can't even beging to list them. I don't think La Leche Legue will ever help anyone wean. It would be like a catholic preaching buddism. I read much more practical suggestions in ""What to expect the toddler years"""
NEGATIVE	Great graphics, great idea, great game play, but I beat it in 2 days after renting it from Blockbuster. Since there aren't enough missions and too easy I give it a 2 star rating. I prefered Hitman 2 it has more missions and is over all more fun since it takes longer to beat.
POSITIVE	The best night time CD for infants, toddlers and young children. All my children listen to this when they fall asleep at night. I start playing this when they are infants and my 9 year old still falls asleep to this CD. It is very soothing.
NEGATIVE	"Steinke doesn't create believable characters. It doesn't seem as though she cares about them herself. What could be an enlightening look at the ""seamy"" side of life in SanFrancisco, in the end isn't even ""provocative,"" because it's so obvious that she doesn't care about these people as more than cartoon characters doing lurid things she writes about woodenly. What got this book into print and reprinted? Okay, so sex sells...but if you buy this book for that reason, you won't find anything sexy about it. Graphic details are written of in flat, sometimes laughable, prose and what's included between these events is vapid and dull. I don't resent her choice of subject matter. I resent how she doesn't care about it, her characters, her readers, the truth. This is an ugly book"
NEGATIVE	just an excuse by a dvd company to squeeze out a few more dollars but cutting out all the sex scenes of a porn flic and re marketing as a movie with somewhat of a story...DON'T buy this piece of crap..
NEGATIVE	"I used this model twice and promptly returned it. The ""turbo-driven"" brush works only by the suction of the vacuum; it has no additional motor. This means that if the suction is ever less than perfect, the brush stops turning and is useless. Actually it's worse than useless because the non-turning brush then blocks the airflow and hampers suction. So I would not recommend this model."
NEGATIVE	"To put it short, ANACONDA is bad. Absolutely mind-numbingly bad. It's not even worthy of being a ripoff of JAWS, because the mention of that would insult the much better movie. The sad part? Jon Voight, Jennifer Lopez, and Bill Paxton are all good actors. It's not even worth of being called a guilty pleasure. The only pleasure I feel is the pleasure that it's over, and the ""guilty"" part? I'm guilty of actually watching this. Movie Police, lock me up."
POSITIVE	I attended a lecture the author gave summarizing his book. If you're interested in globalization, the environment, or any other global problems, I highly recommend reading this book. It was deliberately limited in length, so it is a really quick read... about 5 pages for each of 20 problems and an additional 100 pages or so presenting the general problems and his proposed solution.
POSITIVE	"Debido a los otros comentarios al respecto de este disco quiero aclarar que Caifanes NO es lo mismo que Jaguares. Son dos grupos diferentes ya que en Caifanes la guitarra estaba en primer plano. El unico pero que le pongo a este CD es que solo incluyeron 2 canciones del MTV Unplugged. Me hubiera gustado que incluyeran todo el MTV unplugged en el segundo disco. Las guitarras de Marcovich se aprecian mas en las versiones en vivo ya que existe la certeza de que no hay ""overdubbing"" (Regrabaciones). Un buen disco para empezar. Estoy seguro que si este es el primer disco de Caifanes que se adquiere pronto nacera la curiosidad por conocer las canciones que no se incluyen de los otros discos."
NEGATIVE	We bought these last year and they are completely useless. The steak knives rust and the cooks knives never held an edge. Save your money and do not buy these useless and worthless knives.
NEGATIVE	"I must admit that I found the below reviews far more enjoyable than the Rubenstein E Flat. In the notes (referring to Lhevinne's American debut in 1906) one finds ""The critics even then thought the concerto old-fashioned, and thus ended the history of the Rubinstein E Flat"". I don't mind ""old-fashioned"", but I do mind unnecessarily bloated music filled with mediocre melodies. In that light, I don't find it inappropriate at all that ""thus ended the history of (this concerto)"". Yes, there were ""huge chordal stretches, healthy virtuosity, and chromatic flourishes"", however I don't find this to make ""excellent music"" or ""good sound"" as says David Dubal. Those qualities are inherent in music that endures. In my mind the Rubinstein E Flat fails that test."
NEGATIVE	This transmitter didn't work for me. Had no power when I plugged it into the cigarette lighter. I have a Toyota Corolla. Have to return. Very disappointed.
POSITIVE	Love the product. We used it on our vacation. The only negative I can say about the GPS was that it would take us right straight into major cities (downtown) instead of taking freeway loops. So you really do need a physical map to make sure the GPS is giving you the best route. We loved the feature of finding stores, motels and such. The GPS even gave phone numbers in which to call ahead.
POSITIVE	Great dvd for anyone wanting a well behaved dog. It's best suited for those bringing a puppy home but the techniques can be used for older dogs as well. I have a 2 1/2 year female pitbull (dog aggressive)and used the techniques they outline in the behavior section in order to correct her when showing aggression toward other dogs. Needless to say she much more well behaved around other dogs when out on our walks. As a result, she's much calmer and is finally able to enjoy the walks we take!The philosphy they teach may be a bit long at times but well worth listening to. This dvd is not meant for those people who are too sensitive to the type of physical correction they teach. They are by no means cruel or advocate physical punishment as a means to train BUT they do teach you the proper way to physically correct them in a way that does not hurt the dog but gets their attention. Their techniques work period! My dog and I are much happier as a result of this dvd.JG
NEGATIVE	I've tried many of the Sweetleaf Stevia liquid flavors and have throughly enjoyed all of them, but the root beer one is one I will never buy again.I love root beer, even diet root beer and this liquid is very weak compared to the other liquids. The other products I can put a half of a dropper into 64 ounces of water and have a perfect taste. The root beer takes two or three times this amount to get any taste in the liquid and it is not a true taste.The english toffe, vanilla creme, chocolate raspberry dark chocolate and cinnamon are all great tasting.
POSITIVE	This book proves the adage that a picture is worth a thousand words! By looking at all the details on each page, the story unfolds. (We particularly loved to follow where the balloon went off to!) A cute little story with a sense of humor!My dds are both almost teenagers, but this is still a fondly remembered book!
NEGATIVE	Yes, it's been done before: Add Dances With Wolves to the King and I and what do you get? Well, you would get a LOT MORE than this movie, but generally you get the idea...The acting is generally average, with the exception of the usual Tom Cruise faux intensity, replete with the usual faux intellectual/academic post movie interviews...As for action scenes, the audience get's to watch a slo-mo repeat of one sword-swingning scene presumably to show us how great the fist version would have been had it been properly filmed...and the epic scenes are, well, simply put, NOT EPIC.The lack of love interest is apparent in the apparent lack of interest in the female character by Cruise - no surprise - which leaves the male viewer with little more than some OK aikido, iaido and sushi.The only thing missing was a rice-rocket motorcycle scene. No Top Shogun here.
NEGATIVE	"Comparing the 2011 ""prequel"" to the 1982 original is like a masterclass in the difference between modern Hollywood and even the Hollywood of just a few decades ago.The Thing (1982) was a gory horror/sci-fi film aimed mostly at teens and nerds (or both, like me) but it has great performances, edgy dialogue, and truly frightening and disturbing scenes.The Thing (2011) has interchangeable characters who might as well not even have names, by-the-book CGI, no atmosphere, and no suspense. It barely even has the jump-scares that normally Hollywood can be expected to deliver.In 1982, Kurt Russell scraped hot wires in petri dishes of blood to divine who was a monster and who wasn't.In 2011, Flavor of the Month Actress #7209 shone a flashlight into the other characters' mouths to see if they had fillings to divine who was a monster and who wasn't.'Nuff said."
NEGATIVE	This is truely a fascinating story, but unfortunately the author is unable to write his way out of a paper bag. His writing style is so uneven and jagged that it was often very hard for me to follow the story line.
POSITIVE	Wow!This is a GREAT book for the graphic/web designer wanting to learn actionscript. I own or have read many others that don't cover the basics or the thought processes behind writing in a scripting language. Most books on this topic started out over my head with little explaination and were accompanied by buggy and/or old code. With clear and consice writing, Philip uses the first half of the book to fully explain programming concepts as they pertain to scripting in Flash, and then follows up with examples of how to implement these ideas.I can't say enough about how far this book has taken me into the scripting world. Kudos to Kerman.
POSITIVE	These look very cute, versatile, and simple. They bend easily. The teeny tiny size is perfect for my small ears. The detailing is lovely. These are easy to put on and take off. They are so comfortable that today I thought they fell out because I couldn't feel them all day long. I wore these to sleep once and they didn't fall off. They stay on firm, but not painfully tight. Great price. These are a must-have!
NEGATIVE	The reason I chose Panasonic DVD recorder over other brand is that product is still made in Japan. Most of other DVD recorders now are made in China. I really fell in love with it when I first received it. This is my dream machine I have been yearning a long time ago, so I can retire my vcr. But six months later the machine broke down, I took it to Panasonic to have it service. The machine is still under guaranteed so I don't have to pay anything. Panasonic has good service. And a week ago my machine broke down again. I don't know if I can trust Panasonic DVD recorder anymore.
NEGATIVE	We bought my Granddaughter a new HP Notebook at Wal Mart this past weekend I am setting it up for her so she will have some games to play when she opens it on Christmas Morning. Windows 7 gives me an x86 error and won't install the game. I should return it but for price paid it's not worth the trouble.
NEGATIVE	This book makes one of the classic mistakes - instead of showing the reader about the characters through their actions, the author tells the reader. That was one of the distracting things about this book - the dialogue didn't match the actions. So, we have a genius vampire heroine who spends more time thinking about what she's going to wear to a meeting than what's going on in the mission to which she's been assigned. She's an ex-ninja that never does a single martial arts move. Instead, she continually resorts to brute strength. I, like a previous reviewer, was frustrated with her interaction with her love interest. She keeps telling him she has to be equal in the relationship but she never acts like one - again telling instead of showing. She jeopardizes her own mission in order to help out his, not even knowing what his goal was.On the plus side, it is an interesting concept and does show promise...if the heroine ever starts using that genius IQ.
POSITIVE	If you love period pieces with a romantic element, watch this one! Eddie Redmayne was fantastic! His character will draw you in. The chemistry between Redmayne and his love interest, played by Clémence Poésy, was spell-binding! PBS has done it again!!
POSITIVE	I hesitated to buy this because similar digitizers seem to cost about twice as much (and so this seemed TOO cheap), and because several reviewers were unable to get the hardware to work at all. In fact, I did have some trouble installing the software -- one of the three CD-ROM's kept hanging up during the installation, until I selected the option to install only certain programs and avoided all the sample images and video. But after that, I was able to plug in my old VHS machine and create AVI movies from 25-year-old tapes. (Eventually I'll make DVD's.) I have yet to look at any of the instructions, and I was nonetheless able to add titles and simple transitions between scenes; the movie editor seems quite similar to iMovie on the Mac. I don't know if this will work for everyone, but on my 2006 Windows XP machine Dazzle really dazzled.
POSITIVE	No one deserves this prize more than this outstanding collection of poetry by one of America's most original and powerful poets. Ai's work is violent and sometimes not easy to read--she's a prophet and a scribe, speaking truths with the voice of unflinching authority and writing them down without compromise. An absolutely superb gathering of her work.
NEGATIVE	I recollect reading, when this movie came out, that it was based on a stand-up comedy skit about 9 minutes long. At that length, it probably worked. But expanded to 90 minutes or so, it simply doesn't. Yeah, I know it's supposed to be satire of sorts, but it's not funny. Both of the main characters are dense beyond belief, and all the people at their reunion are stereotypes. The movie is so desperate to fill time that it has R&M go through the reunion TWICE, and it's not funny either time! You do get to see Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino in their bras and panties, but that's not enough to make this turkey worth watching, let alone buying.
NEGATIVE	My three year old daughter just received this doll for her birthday. I had seen it in the store loved the face but did not buy it because the outfit was too revealing. I can't see why they dont put a cute jumper or capri outfit on them, would you dress a baby in that kind or outfit? Well much to my horror she received this doll and I accepted it until I saw that under her skirt was a black thong, A BLACK THONG???? who in the world made this doll and what were they thinking this doll is marketed to small children, kindergarten age it is way too inappropriate, I will keep this doll but I will find an appropriate outfit. Baby Bratz don't buy it unless you want your child to think dressing trampy is wonderful the skirt barely covers her tushy. I think this doll can make the news maybe shame on you, it deserves to get noticed. Way too sexy for children.
POSITIVE	If you like (or love) Dickens,this is the publication for you. Short concise articles on all phases of Dickens writings/life/andthing close to Dickens writings or life is featured. GREAT pub. Keep up the great work!
NEGATIVE	This book describes the unconditional love a parent has for his or her child in a way that I feel is less than ideal. It alludes to the mother's death (which isn't something I am interested in explaining to my child at this stage) and, although it is the mother in this case, makes children aware of the fact that someone could sneak into their room at night. From an adult's perspective the ideas in this book could be construed as sweet and sentimental, but this is a CHILDREN'S book and for that reason I would definitely recommend that parents keep looking (personally, I am a fan of Guess How Much I Love You).
POSITIVE	Toreador does a good job of introducing the world history of the Vampire game without just being an info-dump. The story is well-told, if not ultimately surprising. A late-night movie hostess is accosted by a man that claims to have a new role for her. After sharing her story with him, he tells her a tale about the origin and evolution of vampires.Then we get to the bitey-fangy stuff.The art alone is worth it. Vince Locke is always worth the investment.
POSITIVE	this is my 1st experience with the group cold i went and listened to the sound samples on amazon and really liked the songs and i went and bought the cd and the song samples don't do the cd justice ! every song on here was great but the best song on the album i think is the title track A Different Kind Of Pain , altho all the songs was great this is my favorite , i have never heard of cold before this won't be my last cd i buy of this group !! way to guys !! excellent cd !!!
POSITIVE	"I just love it when I stumble onto a band which turns out to be as great as the Don Miller Orchestra. Having heard almost nothing about them prior to getting this CD, I was more than pleasantly surprised with what I found. This is one outstanding musical aggregation. Don Miller must be rated as one of the top male singers in the swing business today, and he is matched by girl singer Tina Halvorson. I would also like to give special recognition to writer/arranger Jeff Driskill; he has done a superb job recreating the sounds we heard from bands of the early fifties. Particularly good are their versions of ""Almost Like Being in Love"", ""Cheek to Cheek"" and ""Peel Me a Grape"", but there isn't a clunker in the whole group."
POSITIVE	We had an alert just days after we received our weather radio and it worked great! We intend to take it with us when we travel.
NEGATIVE	"I'm just going to be quick and straight with everyone.""Only one side work!!"" ""The Left Side!!""Buy at your own risk....."
NEGATIVE	My family is a big fan of old classics and actors such as Lucille Ball and Cary Grant. However, we found these films to be funny, on the depressing side. The humor was related to bad situations rather than funny lines.
NEGATIVE	Robin Cook has a political message, but is not content to let the message come across with anything less than the force of a sledgehammer. He has rammed the same message about managed care down the readers throat one time too often. I found this book was extremely annoying to read, despite the fact that I agree with the message! Dr. Cook does not seem to even try to develop his characters, and the writing is what one would expect from an eighth grader, not a mature author. Don't waste your time reading this one!
POSITIVE	It will change the way you view TV. The best feature is the user interface, ease of use and the recording of all live TV so you can stop whenever and never miss anything. The 80 hours is a little misleading since this is at the lowest quality, which you will not want. I use medium quality and this works fine for almost everything. At that level you get between 50-60 hours. not a problem since it's easy to delete old stuff. They did a great job with he interface.
NEGATIVE	This was nice if you are an into the English language. I learned:That people will follow strong leaders into death for no reason.Racism is very comical.And More
POSITIVE	Dear Potential Reader:I have nothing but praise for Dr. Danner's _Discover It_. He has taken one of the best methods for self-help learning, the graduated inductive method, and combined it with accurate information about the origins of English words. The reader is led, step by step, into developing an ever larger and more enriched English vocabulary. I would say that anyone who works through the entire book will acquire a level of etymological knowledge and a facility with English vocabulary that normally could only be produced by a course in etymology taught at the college level. My own preference would be for students to learn the relevant languages; _semper nobis linguae addiscendae sunt_. But short of learning Latin, Greek, French, and German, you can do nothing better for building your English vocabulary than to buy and use Danner's _Discover It!_. I highly recommend it.
POSITIVE	I read the HAB theory over 10 years ago, promptly lost my copy and have been searching for another ever since. This book had been the topic of many late night debates and I can't wait to get another look at this facinating theory. Great science offered in a compelling story. Read it!
NEGATIVE	Thank goodness i am not alone.I totally agree withreviewers DAN RYAN and SCOTT R STOUT.This is not music.Garbage,yes.Not even worthy of one star.Musical tastecertainly does differ.
NEGATIVE	....OK For The 6th. Grade Comic Book Reader..(Do Kids Still Read Comics?)..For Adults, It's Insulting & Moronic..!...A REEL STINKER..!
NEGATIVE	Like the others, I will not buy this item unless I can chose the color. Of course the color matters. The company must not understand that customers like choices.
POSITIVE	The content of this movie was excellent history. The movie itself was rather dark and the words hard to hear. The actual facts that this was the first successful open heart surgery, guided by the genius and courage of the people involved. The fact that it took place in the 1940's and the racial bigotry was painful.
POSITIVE	A very nice collection of rhymes for children, most of which are uniquely American. This is not only a nice little book for children and for the serious student of children literature (it won the 1946 Caldecott Medal for best illustration in a book for children), it is also a source of Americana.
NEGATIVE	THIS DVD (BY UNICORN STUDIO/LEISURE ENTERTAINMENT) HAS A LOT OF GLITCHES WITHIN THE ENTIRE WORKOUT AND IT IS RATHER ANNOYING. I HOPE GOODTIMES STUDIO RELEASES THIS DVD IN THE FUTURE.
POSITIVE	This is a great CD, could be a five star album...but there are a couple songs which aren't as good of quality. Fans of Lifehouse and Dexter Freebish should check this one out. Recommended.
POSITIVE	Well, I didn't waste my time reading Out of Ivy as I thought I would. As a self-proclaimed expert on elite academia, I thought I had heard all there is to know about the sad state of educational affairs within these top schools. But Mr. Rowley reveals shocking revelations to even those who stay on top of the subject. Yes, some of his stories make you laugh, but some of them just make us realize how far behind the conservative movement remains on these campuses. It's discouraging to anyone who is concerned about the future of this country.
POSITIVE	"I did not know that this film existed until I saw it discussed in a recent BBC television documentary, ""Felicity Kendal's Indian Shakespeare Quest"". ""Shakespeare Wallah"" was her first film and, indeed, a fictionalized story of her family - co-starring both her mother and her father!One of the earliest Merchant/Ivory collaborations, it features many of the stylistic hallmarks there were to characterize their later films.All things considered, a very good watch!"
NEGATIVE	"I was very excited to read this book when I bought it, but, when I got to the 150/something page, I gave up, because I lost interest instantly after a series of boring issues. 1- The story is not fast paced at all, apparently he loves to write the following a lot, he himself-they themselves-A LOT!!, the protagonist, being the man in the situation, acts so stupid, as to sit around and do nothing when peoples is getting killed by his decisions. Even getting to the point to saying, ""waste the bitch"" as signal to the way one was getting killed. Toooo descriptive that gets boring. In general this could have been a kick ass book, taking out the stupidity and inaction for the main character, making him more ferocious, not talking too much non sense, and by keeping a pace well stated. By the way, I gave away the book, with the book-marker in it, marking my give up point..."
NEGATIVE	Professor Alexander is a pioneer is the field of sports history, but his short history of baseball pales in comparison to what has cme since. He never fails to take a potshot at his betes noire, nor cackle over his pet theories, making this a hard read.
POSITIVE	JK Rowling just keeps making these books better and better. I am nearly foaming at the mouth waiting for the 7th book.
NEGATIVE	"I read this when I had broken my leg and I must say I was not that impressed. The ending with him leaving the cherry pie where his wife and daughter could get at it was unmotivated. I don't understand why the character wanted his wife to catch his curse. Also, I had just read ""100 Years of Solitude"" before this and it made it clear why this is not literature. There was no concentration or density to the writing. It did not look like he broke a sweat to write it. Also, since this was a Richard Bachman book originally, it was trite how he had Backman refer to a ""Stephen King"" book. This is a book that should have stayed in the drawer. Also, it was apparent that he didn't research much about the Gypsies. The supposed Romany language was actually another language, I read."
NEGATIVE	But there're too many of them and they don't seem to get tied together very well. There are too many new characters to begin with and too many new ones being introduced. And with Rand's gargantuan task of uniting all the countries, I have little patience for the unnecessary dialogue and constant bickering.I couldn't possibly care less about how pretty Rand's buttocks are, or how the set of some unnecessary character's nose keeps him/her from being good looking; and I'm tired of reading about how men and women won't ever understand each other and the inevitability of Nynaeve, Elayne and Egwene bickering with one another. That bit with Mat and Queen Tylin (another useless character) was disgusting and something I didn't need to read.
NEGATIVE	"I also purchased the mp3 download and it is NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS OF 2 SONGS!! Sparkling in the Sand and Knock Yourself Out are from the ""East Bay Grease"" CD. They are NOT EVEN LIVE VERSIONS, no less from Live and in Living Color. These certainly ought to be pulled from the site for purchase, or fix the horrid error."
NEGATIVE	The story was OK, though I prefer Odd Thomas... The problem was the eBook / Kindle edition was almost painful to read due to the double spaced lines. Blech...UPDATE....I was very new to Kindle when I wrote the above review and now know how to adjust line spacing. Still not overly impressed with the story, but I'm so taken with Odd Thomas that it may well be biasing my opinions of other work by Mr. Koontz.
NEGATIVE	Waste of time and money. This is probably the worst movie I've scene. I'm not a tough critic of movies but this movie is horrible. Don't watch it!
NEGATIVE	someone get her vocal lessons! completelt unoriginal and oversung... dont waste your money
POSITIVE	I have tried a few types of batteries, but these are top notch (as the price suggests). In my Canon A620 I can take about 300 pictures and many battery draining videos before these Sony batteries go dead. In my Xbox 360 controller I've had one set in for a few months without having to change them. I have multiple sets of energizer rechargeable batteries at work, and they don't hold a charge as long or completely die within a month or so. These Sony ones last longer then any other batteries that I have tried. I will not use any other brand now.
NEGATIVE	I have AT&T Uverse and this did not work well at all with the receiver box. The RF transmitter unit that went inside the Uverse remote in lieu of a battery appeared to cause the remote to be underpowered. Signal was intermittent.
POSITIVE	I have not used the pan yet but I can say it is made of really heavy duty material; not at all flimsy.
POSITIVE	then this is the dvd for you. Informative without being dry. The footage of the Panda's is great. It's good for the entire family. Another quality product from the nature televison program.
NEGATIVE	"Can you give less than one star?After ordering the hat, I got an email from Star Struck stating that they were ""sold out"" and made an error.They continued, ""If you find it in your heart to forgive this blunder and allow us another chance to delight you, we would like to extend the coupon below in appreciation of your loyalty and trust... ""The funny thing is that the coupon code they gave me for a whopping 10% off EXPIRED 2 months ago. Also, the hat I ordered was $17 and the minimum price to use the coupon code was $25. Yeah, they ""delighted me."""
NEGATIVE	I ordered 2 of these maats, one for each litterbox. I was disappointed in how small they were. I returned them since the cats would just really walk around them. If they were about 6 inches larger, they would be great.
POSITIVE	I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE this show. Highly recommended for people who like messed up shows with lots of drama. This show is so awesome.
NEGATIVE	The author rambles on endlessly in what appears to be an attempt to impress the reader with complicated and cryptic prose. It is the worst art book I've ever purchased. Save your money!
POSITIVE	Bought this as a gag gift for my husband because I always enjoyed the human game of 20 questions. The text is soooo easy to see compared to the hand held versions, and because it goes around and there are two sets of text it is easy to play with several people. Best of all, it can guess amazingly precisely just when you think it is way off! How it got Recliner I'll never know. Anyway, it makes this old gal feel like a kid again. It is big and sturdy and I confess, I sometimes play it with my toes! Addictive alone, but it is very fun with a group.
POSITIVE	I bought it as a gift for my Little Sister. She has 3 children, and her carpet always dirty. Now, with this SpotBot, carpet looks like new.
POSITIVE	Easy to install, looks and works great, perfect for installing a small TV. Could see no difference in quality from those costing 3 x as much!
POSITIVE	james rollins writes great novels and this is one of the best i have all his novels now but i have not read them all they are great to take to the beach with me
POSITIVE	I have a radar on my boat. I've used it extensively and thought I knew what I was doing. But this book pointed out a number of important considerations that I was totally unaware of. Anyone with a radar on their boat would benefit from this book.
NEGATIVE	I bought these two years ago and was so excited. We planted the tomatoes as directed and watered as directed and grew beautiful tomato vines, but no tomatoes. After tending these all summer I was not amused. A friend in another town bought them the next summer (before talking to me) and the same thing happened to him. This is a total gimmick that does not work. Don't use your limited gardening time on these planters.
NEGATIVE	I purchased this Chi for my daughter having owned my own Chi for eight years. This new version is a sorry replica of the original. It is half the weight of the older version making it more challenging to vary pressure while running the length of the hair. The construction is also poor with gaps between the cermamic plates and wand which catch and break hair. It feels like a knock-off and, considering the price of the new one was half of the old, that may be the case.
NEGATIVE	This blu-ray did not play on either of my blu-ray players - both Sony. Another reviewer says he was told that it will not play on PS3 or Sony. You may have problems with it.
POSITIVE	I have continued to keep the 2nd edition close by at work. The authors have put maximum in minimum of words, concise and truly useful from a trainee's point. The articles are brife, and yet complete and pictures are highly illustrative. With extensive new information added to the field of nephrology every day, a new edition of this masterpiece is sorely needed. I will wait for the new edition to hit the bookshelves. Do the authors have any such plans?
NEGATIVE	shortly after i bought it, it no longer works. should have registered the waranty!
NEGATIVE	"I really wanted to know the identity of the stalker and more about how the three brothers got this way. These guys are just too twisted. I'm sorry that my curiosity got the best of me and kept me buying these books because I wouldn't consider this a ""love"" story."
NEGATIVE	The only thing F-Hed has any business putting out is that supposed sex tape. He has no ability as a writer or rapper. This album stinks on ice.. Peeeeee-yuuuuuuuuuu.........
NEGATIVE	Cretu is missing! and some look-a-like has taken his place! This album really sounds like a counterfit. Two stars because the only good tracks are 1 and 11, sort of, ok maybe 10 too. These are the only tracks that come close to what Enigma is or was. Everything in between leaves very much to be desired. The lyrics and synth sound very ameturish. *sigh* I hope he returns soon and recovers from this. I love Enigna, but not this.
NEGATIVE	I have used these zips in the past and they have a tendency to quit working for no apparent reason.However I still use them on a MAC at work for certain projects. The newest problem I've encountered is totry and reformat the Zips to a newer operating system MAC OS10. It wouldn't reformat.So I do not recommend the Zip Drives for newer operating systems. On the older computers they should work fine.
NEGATIVE	buying this book is bad investment, demorgrapics says people are growing old, so buy cannon because the old people will buy its cameras to take photos of their grandchildren, what kind of logic is that? is it a safer bet to buy companies making adult diapers?
POSITIVE	Thank goodness Harlequin Blaze has finally opened up to more diverse characters. I too thought this interracial, until I read Mia's review below. I've been reading this line, Harlequin Temptation before it, and other romances for years. I've always hated the segregation of these characters. And yes, I've read the books where the hero or heroine is 1/8th something -- just enough to call it 'exotic.' Category romance has been the last world to be integrated. It's a good thing.
POSITIVE	"This was my ""childhood game"" and after a while they stop selling it of course because it was no longer available for the newer computers or whatever. Finally i got it but i had it to download a port in order to play it ( it's free ) im very happy and satisfied with this game. Duke Numkem is the badest game out there!"
POSITIVE	"a pie was made.No Mercy took the first slice.Then Wrestlemania 2000.then Smackdowns 1-3 took a medium slice.thats when SYM was about to eat the rest,until Here comes the pain came and kicked the 5 games asses.I mean, legends,BLOOD,Elimination chamber,Goldberg,and if you play as Shawn michaels in season up to Wrestlemania XX you will run into a ""Pink&Black""suprise.If I could I would give this game a million stars.SO DONT RENT BUY,BUY,BUY DAMNIT"
POSITIVE	"""I give her 50/50 do you remember Mr Crispy at the hospital"" great halloween movie."
POSITIVE	It had been so long since Gato had released an album, I thought he had disappeared from the music scene. From Tropico on, Gato seemed to have lost his bearings only occasionally showing glimpses of his storied past. Now here he is again after a ten year hiatus and he's back on track. Que Pasa opens with the wonderfully smooth Straight into the Sunrise and winds up with the moving Adentro. Though I like every cut on this CD, the best are Straight Into the Sunrise, Blue Gala, and a tremendous rendition of Stevie Wonder's Cause We've Ended As Lovers which is even more powerful than Jeff Beck's standout version. I recommend this to anyone who appreciates saxophone and especially to Barbieri apostates who had given up on him. Que Pasa is a winner!
NEGATIVE	Recently I cancelled my cable connection after seeing that I could save $35 a month by just buying this book and using it instead. What I got was really disappointing, it doesn't even have Facebook inside it. My kids are now restless at night because they can't see their friends' pictures and updates. My wife isn't too happy either, this book hardly mentions anything about celebrities. This is really misleading and I am contacting the publisher. If you are looking for the whole Internet ON PAPER then look elsewhere, don't buy this!
NEGATIVE	Previously, this Dermalogica masque was amazing. It was a clear gel that absorbed into the skin well and left it feeling soft. The product has since changed. I received a mask that was the consistency of snot, not at all it's original clear gel form! It was milky yellow. When I tried to wash it off my face after 15 minutes, it left a greasy film on my skin. I had to go back and use another facial cleanser to wash the greasy feeling off my face. This mask is no longer what it used to be and I will definitely not buy this product again!
POSITIVE	Gud watch for the price offered. The background light is good. I got the watch last month and i use it for gym activities.
POSITIVE	If you're a fan of the traditional Mersey Beat beat, i.e., two guitars, bass, drums and harmony, you will love the Best of the Merseybeats. While certainly not in the class of the Beatles, or maybe even the Searchers, the Merseybeats are still a very good group. Guitarists Tony Crane and Aaron Williams blend very well together, and Crane and bassist Johnny Gustafsson work some wonderful harmonies. This collection is one of my favorites. Some of the better songs include Really Mystified, I Stand Accused and I Think of You. I certainly have no regrets about purchasing it.
POSITIVE	The first bit of the movie, I guess I wasn't paying attention to or not reading the subtitles fast enough, because I had no idea what was going on. A third of the way through everything started clicking for me and from about that moment on I was completely enthralled. The suspense built up at a steady pace and I was gripping my chair waiting to see what would happen next. I thought it was shot well, the actors acted well, and the whole thing was a great film.
NEGATIVE	This book is a complete waste of money. I bought it last year before going up to Hong Kong. It is very outdated and not at all helpful.
NEGATIVE	Mediocre, I thought. Slow-moving and rather predictable at the end. It seemed like two books, the first very interesting dealing with Martin's reaction to his condition, the second a drawn out 100 page explanation of what happened to the girl he was seeing. There was very little connection between the two halves of the book other than Nina herself and the man following her. Overall, I thought the concept was interesting but not well played out.
NEGATIVE	Pages and pages of scales on the musical stave , which one then has to convert to diagrams . Thinks ' why am I doing all this extra work ' ? Then thinks .. get a better book .Chords are allowed diagrams ... but not hard , hard , hard scales .
NEGATIVE	This diet is almost impossible to follow.I work outdoors in construction,you have to eat six times a day.Difficult to follow if you work in the field.Maybe if you work in an office or at home.
NEGATIVE	"This is a terribly dangerous product. Do NOT buy for your pet! I have a 50 lb+ 9-month old Am Staff who chewed bits of the ends off of this ""toy"" and he has been vomiting and not eating for 4 days. I have contacted the company and am waiting to hear back. I cannot believe this product has not been recalled. I don't believe it is non-toxic, it's either not being tested properly or they are not being truthful about their product."
NEGATIVE	IT takes a rocket Scientist to figure out out to make it work--too difficult for anyone to figure out ( 3 people tried) and the screen goes out at exactly the same time you figure it out. Too expensive to be so frustrating, don't buy.
NEGATIVE	Chillow worked just as promised, but was FAR too cold. My face was numb within the first few minutes of use. I tried covering it with pillowcases of various materials and textures, with towels, and so on - it was always too cold or too hot. It's a great idea but I think there are probably very few people who can actually use this item.
POSITIVE	I work in a machine shop & have a constent background noise. I originally had the M12 but thought I would give the M22 a try. I ended up returning the M22 in exchange the M12 due to the volume. The M12 seemed to be louder than the M22. Would recommend this product. I gave it a 4 star because it still could be a bit louder.
POSITIVE	"This is a good example of what early bop records sounded like--crisp and compact 3 minute sparks. Silver's piano playing is at the forefront, and he shines on numbers such as ""Opus de Funk"" and ""Quicksilver."" Blakey's drums thunder throughout, and the addition of Sabo Martinez on conga adds zesty flavour to ""Message from Kenya"" and ""Safari"" (my personal favourites due to their titles). Though Silver would make better music with his quintet and sextet, he is in very good form on this album."
NEGATIVE	"This is one of the most mesmorizingly awful horror movies I've ever seen! Irritatingly inept and insipid, this slasher has dubious jokes, sharp shocks of gore, ill logic, and mind-numbing predictability to make you wish you had rented something else. The movie is so banal you can play ""Mystery Science Theatre"" while watching it. Even Halloween 6 would do the job better! While wathcing this movie on T.V. I can remember what my Dad said after commercial breaks:""Aw, we have to watch the movie? I was hoping we could watch more commercials!""That statement should tell you something."
POSITIVE	I bought this item because I read a review that states the item comes with a free picatinny rail mount adapter. That is not true. This item will only fit a Sling Stud Mount. Im dissapointed because the item was very well constructed and looks durable.
NEGATIVE	I sent this toaster back after 4 weeks of occasional use. I bought it after reading all the great customer reviews and was greatly disappointed. The toaster does have the capacity to toast quite thick items such as bagels, but for a regular slice of toast, it does not do a good job. Because of the wide openings for bagels, when it pulls down a regular size piece of bread, it pulls the bread closer to one side rather than right in the middle. I like my toast medium brown, it always came out with one side medium brown and the other side was merely warmed--no color.
NEGATIVE	I was expecting a lot more of this books pictures. You can hardly tell any of these animals are nursing! Only the first picture gives a clear view. The cats and pigs had no nipples in the usual 2 rows. The upright animals showed no breast. The human's nipple would have been way to high for the baby's position. The major one for me was showing the cow with no udders, that's so wrong!!If you're still nursing a toddler and wanting to read to them about it, you can probably handle seeing a little boob. I wanted to read this with my bilingual 2 year old who's still nursing but after the monkey he lost interest because you can't tell what's going on.
POSITIVE	Got mine a gift. It's a cute setup of monkey toys and books. It has a lot of helpful advice and tools for helping with kid's bowel and bladder habits including toilet training (sometimes hard to do!) Overall, would recommend to parents with young kids or as a gift to expecting parents. Only drawback I could see: takes a little practice with some kids.
POSITIVE	The horrible ear buds that came with my pricey MP3 player not only gave me an earache but were a pain in the neck to keep in place. I could wear these little Koss plugs all day long and never know they're there. And sound quality is perfect.
NEGATIVE	"Well constructed characters and a lot of action carry the beginning of this story, but it simply disintegrates at the never-ending end. The willing suspension of disbelief which is essential for the success of a good fiction read becomes more and more difficult as the book progresses. Unexplained details (a character who is described as a ""miracle worker"" is a repeated deus ex machina whom the author inartfully uses to tie up loose plot ends, e.g.), impossible coincidences (an ex-con known to the protagonist just happens - out of the absolute ether - to have the drop dead connection to the bad guy) and unresolved plot lines (what happened to the social worker and the ex-wife? They simply disappeared!) sink this book. Deaver is a talent but it is not evident here. If this was a first novel, it would be tagged with a slew of ""Thanks but no thanks"" letters from any publishers to which it was sent. Too bad."
POSITIVE	This is an excellent LCD Tv with HDTV. Its amazing how many inputs the TV has and all tucked nicely behind the speakers. Has inputs for componet, VGA, s video and FM. Any combination of connections are easliy possible for input and out put. The reamote is very easy to use. I had seen only one pixel defict dot .Its very sleek and goes well on kitchen counter top or for bedroom or bathroom. I connected to Sony HD receiver with directv and pictures are awesome. Awaiting for a model similar to this in little bigger size 23-26 inches in prize range of 1500-2000. I have always been fan of sony and have all my sytems in sony and Bose. However this Tv was an exception and deserves five starts truely
NEGATIVE	"I have had two of these ""tools"". I would rather call them toys, because they are not sturdy enough to actually do any work. I struggled to align and position the blades in such a way as to take off the nice thin shavings that a quality plane would be expected to produce. No matter what I did, the blades would chatter down the work piece resulting in a coarse, pitted edge on anything harder than soft pine. Even the results on pine were sub-par. The wooden body of one of them split during use.Don't waste your money, get a decent champfer plane or use your router."
POSITIVE	This Atlas was invaluable for our August trip to Italy. We traveled all over Northern Italy. It also includes blow up maps of the major cities which were invaluable. The only negative I would say is it didn't have a sign legend to tell you what the different road signs met. Although, they are pretty easy to figure out. Happy Travels!
NEGATIVE	Dewalt maks very good equipment and these are good, but stay clear of the advertised product as I only received one and not 25 as noted. I can purchase these locally for as little as $2.50 each and if I traveled to get to lowes, only $1.50 each. Also, these are refurbished wheels and poor packaging through third-party, unknown seller. Don't get burned like I am.
POSITIVE	This was the my main workout during my recent pregnancy. Most everything else I tried held no challenge. Other reviewers have summed it up well. If I had to say I anything negative about this, it would be that it seems rather low budget for the price. Didn't LOVE the music. And Lauren, while in FANTASTIC shape, doesn't seem thrilled to be there. I can't remember if she smiles even once! None of these were a deal breaker for me. Lauren's credentials are excellent. This workout is also an excellent intro to kettlebells.
NEGATIVE	I purchased two of these phones based upon the previous customer reviews. I was looking for a phone with at least above average sound quality. Other customer reviews gave me the impression that this phone would satisfy these requirements. My previous phone sounded signifiantly better and it was about 1/2 the price. Most people would find the sound quality alright, but if you are looking for above average sound quality you will not find it in this phone. I'm quite disappointed. The rest of the phone's features are fine - no complaints except for the primary reason why I purchased this phone.
NEGATIVE	Plot: Predictable throughout.Symbolism: Heavy-handed.Scenery: Decent (all those nice clean film sheep!) but not worth watching the film for.Characters: Most one-dimensional, and all lacking common sense.Acting: Mostly wooden; occasionally absurd. Meggie's constant sexy twitching (she acts like she's working under a lamppost 24/7)! Her son's leaden sincerity!Costumes and hairstyles: Styles of the 1980s serve seamlessly for the 1920s through the 1960s.Premise: Silly.Summary: Give this film a miss!
POSITIVE	"I bought this disc after hearing a download of the song ""Summertime Thing"". The song clicked with me, and I figured I'd give Chuck a chance. 9 times out of 10 I end up giving the disc one listen, and then it's long forgotten. Well, ""No Other Love"" beat the odds. I can't say enough about this album. At times Chuck's vocals sound a lot like an old favorite of mine, Jerry Jeff Walker. The production on some songs (CP produced this himself) reminds me of Gus Dudgeon's production on some of Elton John's earlier albums. There's even hints of Mark Knopfler in here. That said though, Chuck Prophet is truly an original talent. He puts his all into every song, from writing, singing, guitar playing, and producing. And the variety of songs just keep me wanting to hear the album again and again.There is humor, joy and a definite honesty in this album that is sorely missing in today's arena of popular music. A great album by a talent who truly deserves greater recognition."
NEGATIVE	HelloI was so excited about this thing when I first saw it , hey look and audio interface with XLR and other stuff for only $60 !I bought this and got it shipped to Kuwait by Aramex , unpacked it , connected it and the world started crashing around me.There was this louuuuud so very loud hiss coming out of the XLR input , I checked everything on my laptop with no solution.Hiss and hiss and very loud hisses and whistles.I couldn't record anything , I use a dynamic K&K; Mic , the hiss only goes away when I connect it to the line 2 input in the back , which disconnects the XLR input , but the volume was very low , and when I amplify it by audio software I get loud noise as usual.I ended up throwing this away , and I intend to buy a USB Microphone.So, whatever you are thinking of while looking to this disgusting thing , put it away.
NEGATIVE	"I agree with the other reviewer. I bought all of the books in this series and am shocked at how much of the advice has been taken from previous authors on these topics. She is copying classics like Emily Post and simply re-wording the text. Except for the cute drawings, this series is a waste of money. If you want to know how to do things ""correctly"", read Letitia Baldridge's ""The New Manners For the '90's"". It covers everything and is written by a woman with the education and experience to know of which she speaks! Not someone who using her fashion connections to flood the magazines and talk shows with her ""discovery"" of this information."
POSITIVE	The fast pace, and subtle hints make this a real page turner. This story makes the reader feel for the characters even the bad guy is human. If you enjoy heart racing mystery this is the book for you.
NEGATIVE	ive read his stories online and they are pretty funny. even if they may be made up he still tells them really well. but this movie was terrible. it went too far sometimes. this is one of those movies that is best enjoyed with the people it is about not for a large audience. the only good part of this movie were the hot girls. the dude who played tucker showed some pretty bad acting. what a waste of time
POSITIVE	So if you're a bit like me, you look forward to New Year's Eve and July 4th...not just for all the fun and festivities (and fireworks on July 4th) but also for the Twilight Zone marathon on SciFy. Every year I always catch and episode or two that I've never seen before, and catch a few I know by heart, enjoying every second of it.So during the winter months this year I decided to splurge and buy the entire series box set, every episode in original air date order. This is the Ultimate Twilight Zone package for any fan. Plus bonuses too many to list, complete with a booklet which gives a quick synopsis of every episode. Simply put, you can't do better than this. All struck from the original camera negative and magnetic soundtrack it says right here on the box, and it definitely looks that way on my TV screen.So do yourself a favor, if you're an old fan or new, grab this set and beat those cold winter night blues, you will love it!T
POSITIVE	This cable is solid and works well for me. I purchased this cable to connect my media PC to my Sony 1080i CRT TV. Blu-ray movies look great and the image quality is clean. It was a cinch to use this cable to hook up my TV as an extended desktop for my laptop. The build quality is great at half the cost for similar cables at the local stores.
POSITIVE	Max Payne is one of the most brutal games I have played! I love the matrix type of stuff and the game was all around great! The plot wasnt all that great I thought but with the fighting and all the blood I had to give this game a 5 star!
NEGATIVE	We love Liam, but as much as the family wanted to enjoy this movie, it was just lacking... something (we all agreed). Because it is Part II to Clash of the Titans, most of you will eventually watch it out of dedication. If for nothing else your OCD will get the better of you as if it were unfinished business. All I can say is, don't say I didn't warn you. Personally I'd wait until it is released on cable.
POSITIVE	What can I say ... some things never change ... the seasons, birth, death, taxes, and Ted Nugent. The self indulgent hunter/rocker is still going at it in his 60's ...and I swear, it seems some have made a pact with the devil because they stay forever young. Mick Jagger, Chuck Berry, Steven Tyler, Paul McCartney, and uncle Ted (at least in appearance). This concert focus' on a hometown show in Detroit, and Ted is in top form, playing most of his hits, and a few covers. He humbles himself as much as Ted can and pays homage to some of his hero's including the drummer from Mitch Ryder and the Detroit wheels (who has seemed to make a pact with the devil too), his original guitar teacher (no pact here), and the original singer who does a dynomite job on Stranglehold. You either love or hate Ted, I happen to love him...because he delivers...maybe he has a right to be self indulgent.
POSITIVE	Despite spending a little more than i wanted, This backpack is definately worth the price. Even though its not quite as light as a high end pack..it has performed very well for me. The only gripe I have is the lack of documentation (i.e. cleaning and care instructions)All in all a good pack.
NEGATIVE	It's difficult to find that certain style of acoustical guitar that just soothes your nerves like a balm. I can't find it in this because there were no samples!!!!! Every cd should offer samples.........ya know?
NEGATIVE	Although the first was good, seeing this movie just makes want to puke. This one is should be on the list of the worst movie ever made.
POSITIVE	Must Own Cd By Jodeci It has All The Jodeci Joints From ,stay ,cry for you, forever my lady, i'm still wating , freekin u,latley that was originally made by stevie wonder & More . Classic classic classic jodeci.
POSITIVE	When you're feeling beaten down or confused, this is a good CD to listen to you. It will inspire you to keep pushing forward.
NEGATIVE	This is the memoir of two brothers who gamble away their inheritance at Gulf Coast casinos. Their descent into addiction is both unfortunate and pathetic. Their lives unraveld with the roll of a dice. Often repititious, sometimes sluggish, and certainly not the kind of flowing prose one would expect from two men now employed as college writing instructors.
POSITIVE	This is a product that is not readily available in the marketplace, so I was pleasantly surprised at the price and the speed with which it arrived.
POSITIVE	The last 15 minutes had me on the edge of my seat. Walt is seriously going down a darker rabbit hole. I can't wait to see how this pans out.
NEGATIVE	Video freezes, audio halts,and then continues to the next interruption. Hard to comment on the movie, too irritated to enjoy it. I paid $24.95 for this- a top price for a poorly made product.
NEGATIVE	This is one boring sex story.I agree with one reviewer that this book is all about sex. I found it gross that when Christa walked in on her friend and Max having sex together, her friend offered to share him with her. What followed is one sex scene after the other that are so boring and seem like quickies. Max's obbsession with Christa is weird and all he cared about is how to get the husband out of the way so they can continue having sex, i guess. Ms Johnson suggests that it's OK to commit adultery if your husband is also commiting adultery. I didn't even believe that Max and Christa love each other. They have great sex but I don't think i'll call it love. This book is also overpriced... Don't waste your money.
NEGATIVE	I found this to be an obnoxious, poorly written book. Wells draws on every cliche possible. The characters are so false that I couldn't believe that other readers actually identify with them. I read this book after Little Alters Everywhere and I thought that this book was particularly weird after the sexual, psychological, and physical abuse in the first book. Why is this character idolized by the members of Ya Ya societies everywhere?
NEGATIVE	"If the show has Reed Timmer & Joel Taylor in it, you are sure going to expect an action packed show. Unfortunately, Tornado Glory falls very short of thrilling TV. Save your money & watch the TV series ""Storm Chasers"". You will get much more out of watching the series than this cheap attempt of a DVD."
POSITIVE	I enjoyed this season. I was a little iffy on the finale, but it is still better than a lot of American series. The seasons are more like mini-movies than a regular drama series, but quality is better than quantity in my opinion. The acting is top-notch and the writing is well done. Overall it is a creative show, but the characters are what set it apart from a lot of episodic television out there today.
POSITIVE	I RECEIVED THE DVD QUICKLY AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS MOVIE AS MUCH AS I DID WHEN I WAS HER AGE.
POSITIVE	I tried my new Dyson for the first time today (what a great Mother's Day Present to myself!). We have a small one-story house (3 years old) with 2 dogs and a baby. We keep the place fairly clean... so I thought!On the first run through the house, we emptied the canister SEVEN times!! (How embarrassing!) On the second run through the house, we never needed to empty it a single time. Talk about suction!! Even our high traffic areas are fluffy again!Better yet, it was easier to push than my old vacuum. The center of gravity on the Dyson is lower than your average upright, so it's not constantly tipping over the way my old one did. The extra long cord allowed me to reach the entire house from one central outlet. Assembly was quick and easy, and I LOVE that most of the tubing is removable and washable. Way to go Dyson!
NEGATIVE	This film is completely dreadful, the first challenge will be to stay awake throughtout the film; the second will be to wonder why on earth you wasted your money as the 'fighting' scenes are poor and bear no resemblance to the description on the case of the DVD. Look for a different film.
POSITIVE	The book is great and not only applies to gambling but many other aspects of dealing with money like stocks etc.Great service. Book shipped fast and was in perfect condition.
POSITIVE	I've been to tonnes of concerts.. Listened to alot of Bands. But 5ive has been my fave for such a long time! I've been a fan since before they released a single in the UK..Trust me.. This is finally some pop music you can play without looking like a teeny-bopper. Not to mention.. look how cute they are! But unfortunately you can't have ABS because he has a girlfriend named Danielle..... But the rest are dating! I've got 5ive's autographs from a contests in england(I live in Canada) But until we keep buying their CD's they aren't gonna come! So Buy tonnes of 5ive stuff and DEMAND 5ive E-mail me if you wanna know anything about them ok!
POSITIVE	The first time I listened to this record I was baffled over Mason's choice of subjects and use of loose, reggae- and jazz-flavored rhythms. But after a while, the heartfelt nature with which he paid tribute to Dr. King, the barely-boiling-over anger of Global Empire, the ode to true love in Ballad for My One True Love and the sighing loss of Train Leaving Gray seemed to pinpoint not only the struggles that Mason seemed to be facing as a songwriter but the same struggles that most of humanity faces in one form or another.
POSITIVE	This DVD makes learning the alphabet fun for young children. After 1 week of viewing this DVD, my 2 year old recognized every letter and knew the sounds each letter made. She also began reading 4 months later. (Three letter words.) She is now 4 years old and can read 3rd grade level!Buy this product and enjoy watching your children learn.Vlady
POSITIVE	This is a great game! I have a very large collection of games and love having friends over to play and this is always a favorite. I just wish that there was another refill pack available.
NEGATIVE	This product was frustrating to try to use, the software didn't work, and tech support was very unhelpful, and expensive, considering you waited on hold on a non-toll-free number. I returned it and went with the ATI Radeon All-in-Wonder 7500, which I love.
NEGATIVE	This is a total waste of money!! Everything sticks and burns on the bottom of the pans. We have tried the different pans in the set and had the same issue. Do NOT buy and if you did return them at once!!
POSITIVE	I knew how easy it is to bake a cake using a cake mix from my pantry as a starter, but the results with the recipes in cake mix magic were overwhelmingly good. I served two cakes-Chocolate Cherry Cake and Blueberry Coffe Cake-at a recent party and they were both gone before I even had a piece. But I did get four requests for my recipes.I will certainly recommend this book to my friends.
NEGATIVE	I got the 24 double rolls for $10 (on sale) from Target . This price is double.
NEGATIVE	This might have been ground breaking stuff during the cold war, sure isnt now.I thought i bought Tappan On Survival and NOTTappan On Survival Guns.... His view on guns is screwed up also, if you like readingGuns & Ammo (1-year auto-renewal).... which Tappan wrote for.... by the way Guns&Ammo; sucks!..... you'll love this book. When he is talking about guns, he never mentions the AK47, go figure huh?If your thinking about buying a survival book, check out my other reviews, and stay away from this book! Check outRagnar Benson, thats a good place to start!Very unhappy i bought this book and that doesnt happen very often!
POSITIVE	The price was fair and the item arrived quickly. However, the green light does not seem to work and the directions are not helpful for that problem. If someone would like to advise me how to handle this problem, my number is 847-659-1284.I have to be honest and say that the absence of the green light is not fatal as I really go by the yellow and red lights to park.
POSITIVE	This book is not only a touching search for the author's roots. It is also a fascinating, well researched history of Jews in Central Europe. Very well written, and the detailed description of the search makes it a very readable book.
NEGATIVE	This thing works sometimes, and its cheep. Other then that I don't have much good too say about it. It uses up the ink in the expensive cartridges like water. And is so noisy it sounds like a truck going off road. I've owned quite a few cheep HP ink jet printers, and I've been disappointed by them all. I am going with Epson or paying a little more for a higher model HP. In the print world, you get what you pay for and buying cheep is a bad idea.
POSITIVE	This item is good for the money I paid. The only problem is that the cord constantly jams and makes it inconvenient but you can't complain if you spent less than $5.00. Remember, you get what you pay for.
POSITIVE	"My baby is 10 weeks old and I can honestly say I've only used the nail clippers so far. They are wonderful though, as I have two other brands and can't use either of them. I'm sure I'll get more use out of the other stuff as my baby gets older though. I also bought an ""especially for baby"" kit that was very similar to this one just to keep in her diaper bag because it was cheaper, but definitely spend the extra to get this one. The nail clippers in the other one are useless."
NEGATIVE	"I bought this book thinking I was going to a list of tactics that were going to be innovated and creative to help me promote one of my websites. This book was really vague and didn't offer any tactics. Most of the things listed were things that you already know like ""get involved in the community"", ""attend trade shows"" or others so out of reach like ""Make appearances on Talk Shows"". The book also needs some revising, they a section on taking advantages of free directories like Yahoo and Yahoo's directory hasn't been free for a long time (is only free if you are a non profit).This book is not for a website owner who is trying to promote a product. Save your money and read message boards. I have gotten more ideas that way than from this book."
NEGATIVE	This film is a bigger set of pants than Fat Bastards from Austin Powers!! To think Gale Ann Hurd produced Aliens...
POSITIVE	Clever, quirky characters, and excellent acting. Full of sex and violence--not for the easily offended--but delivered with panache, and always in service to the plot. Really funny too... I loved all of the dark comedic moments. An excellent first-effort by screenwriter Paul Osborne. Can't wait to see what's next.
POSITIVE	"Jean Sablon's ""Le Fiacre"" was why I bought this CD but there is so much more pleasant music on it, and well transferred to CD too. A bonus, thanks to Google, is that it is easy to find all the words, and a rough translation, of each I've tried so far."
POSITIVE	One of the best series ever brought out. I am a zombie flick lover and when I heard about this a couple years ago I went crazy.Good story great replayability never gets old. I would recomend this to everyone and have. Lots of my friends are just as adicted to thid sd I am must buy gor everyone.
POSITIVE	Very unique album for its time. A unique fusion of rock, soul and jazz fusion. One of my all time favorite albums. I have been looking for this album for years, and I am glad it finally came out on CD. I highly recommend it (crazy lyrics aside).
NEGATIVE	"This collection is disappointing because they've worked so hard to clean up the hiss and scratches of recordings made in a hotel room over 70 years ago, that they've so muffled the voice and music that it just doesn't come through realistically. Sony's King of the Delta Blues (Vol.s 1 and 2) offers a virtually complete collection and the diff in sound quality is startling. While you hear more hiss and scratches, the sound of Johnson's voice has a presence that that the ""Complete Collection"" lacks. I already owned the latter and upon hearing the former, went out and bought it. Skip the Complete Collection and get the recording that sounds more real, more alive. If you already own the ""Complete Collection"" and you like the music, bag it and get King of the Delta Blues edition, Johnson deserves to be heard without a towel wrapped over his mouth."
POSITIVE	A biography of a truly beautiful woman! Some celebrities went trough life with everything handed to them on a silver plate, not Donna Reed, she realy had to work for everything she stood for back then and today, not only has a superstar but also as a human being. From her early years in Denison Iowa to her movie and televison career to her activist days to being a devoted mother and wife, get to know about some of her life struggules and pleasures in Jay Fultz's A-1 bio of a wonderfully private person that didn't let fame get the best of her. Under that star image is a down-to-earth extremely intoxicating person with a very charitable heart and giving nature.In my heart she definataly was one of the greatest woman that ever walked God's green earth and is the closest thing to human perfection!.....Rob J.
POSITIVE	I am the husband. My wife loves this stuff, because she gets a sweet tan with no added cancer.I love it because it looks real, as opposed to all the orange ones out there. Just like all self-tanning lotions, it doesn't smell amazing, and you have to wear it over night to get the best effect, and then wash off in the morning... So plan on putting it on at night, sleeping, then take a shower in the morning, and it stains your skin. Looks great, and doesn't smell terrible. stays on for pretty much a week. so one of these every 5 weeks or something, and it is an affordable way to stay tan!
POSITIVE	This is one of my favorite books. You always hear about those books that once you pick up and start reading it you can't stop till you're done. I had never encountered such a book until I found Jaws. It was just so well-written you have to read on. The characters and the plot are well-crafted and interesting. The idea of a 25 foot shark in the water just creeps you out
POSITIVE	This well written and researched book is appealing as a wonderful account of both the funding and construction of the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 (The Great White City) and the Chicago Police's efforts to track down a serial killer who preys on naive young women who come to Chicago looking for jobs during this exciting time. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and almost compels reading in a single seating! I found myself so facinated with the Chicago World's Fair that I have spent considerable time studying it further. Google it and you will feast your eyes on the remarkable architecture of this World's Fair and imagine its profound impact on architecture all over the United States and the world. For example, many cities in New England and elsewhere in the Northeast have buildings that were strongly influenced by this World's Fair.
NEGATIVE	i remember seeing this tour back in the fall of 86 and there is a live disc that came out of it, i would seek that out before getting this one. even for hardmanticore completists its a tough listen. there is only one track that has any real merit, of the rest some are tepid and the others are just plain nightmares. uninispired. plus the eighties style production kills the little soul it has.........
POSITIVE	"After getting ""Thomas the tank engine & friends: Sing-Along and Stories"", I needed to find more Thomas songs and purchased this cassette too. Don't know why, but it never caught on as much as the other cassette. It is still very well done, with the accompanying lyrics displayed on the screen and very colorful, but I still have to cast my vote and say that the ""Tank Engine and Friends"" cassette is better."
POSITIVE	"We absolutely LOVE this cube! I bought it for my 5m nephew...and although he can't quite sit up on his own yet, it is still an entertainer for him. Anytime we want to distract him, we start up the magic cube! The sounds are good (not annoying) and becos you can add and subtract any ""instrument"", it is not boring. I do wish the lights were brighter and more visual, but this is becod the cube itself is so colorful. Great product!"
POSITIVE	This is (another) gem of Mr.Costa, the top class audio audio engineer of Mr.Lincetto's team at velet Luna. The recording is a multichannel 24b@94KHz PCM recording which deliver a truly natural and crips sound, not lacking of dynamic headaroom when needed: a true must for audiophiles, which shows up PCM is not inferior to DSD as hi-rez coding option. This oustanding audio quality serve a great performance of Vivaldi: the orchestra is small, respectful of the original setup, still the sound is brilliant and gourgeous: no match with the dated performance from 'I Musici' (Philips, both version.Highly recommended
POSITIVE	India has always seemd like an exotic, chaotic place to me. After reading this book, it has become more real; a country populated by people not that different from myself. Their ambitions, heartbreaks, and loves will be recognizable to almost anyone. I rarely find a book so riveting.
NEGATIVE	I really like the Covenant series, and so I picked this book up to see how others reacted to it. What I found was a work that read far to much into Donaldson's work, missed some major points, and committed simple errors (such as which hand Covenant had fingers amputated from). Maybe it's because I'm not a huge fan of lit.crit., but I found this text very dense to work through, and Senior came across as trying too hard to make his points.
NEGATIVE	Product was cheap enough - but you get what you pay for.Very weak suction - more noise than power.sawdust is about all it can handle - and at very slow rates.Go for something more powerful
POSITIVE	This is one of my favorite movies and am glad my seller got it to me so quickly and in such good condition.
POSITIVE	Free markets or central planning? Hayek or Keynes?I have seen this documentary a couple of times since it came out and found it very informative and absorbing for it's world historical/economic/political perspective. I should say, I never look to just one source of information no matter how persuasive.I brought it out again yesterday to watch in particular Part 3 which brought the film to it's then current times during the GW Bush administration, just after 9/11, the Seattle Summit demonstrations, and after the market collapses of Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea and Russia. This film was so pertinent, it could have very easily just continued on to the 2007/2008 US and world economic collapse and the devastation and adjustments that we are still living with today right up to the Summit demonstrations in Toronto.I highly recommend this film.The Creation and Destruction of Value: The Globalization CycleHow Markets Fail: The Logic of Economic Calamities
POSITIVE	"I picked up this book because of the title (I have a friend who loves snow) and then noticed the second line said haiku (I have been writing them). When Yuko's father said to him ""Poetry... is a way of passing the time,"" I decided this is a book of a different kind. My only disappointment was that the haiku translations into English were not seventeen syllables. Of course that would be exceeding difficult but I wondered if the translator even tried. I was so intrigued that I intend to get a copy of the French edition."
POSITIVE	"I don't give ratings of ""10"" frivolously. LEGENDS OF THE FERENGI tells how the infamous Ferengi Rules of Acquisition originated. There's lots of humor and good sense to learn. I loved it from beginning to end. One Note: This book is now in audiobook form, a bit different from the book, but just as entertaining. It is read by Quark himself, Armin Shimerman."
POSITIVE	I think this CD is awesome. (this opinion is coming from a 13 year old girl too! HAHA!)! All the songs rock!If you like Wham!, check out my favourite band, soulDecision! They sound like George!!
NEGATIVE	It's a pleasant fragrance but it's not close to the original.Recently, my wife bought me a pair of Irish Spring Body Wash liquid containers. My love affair for Irish Spring was born again. It left me fresh for many hours with that rich fragrance. Those are virtually gone except for a small dispenser I tote with me when on a road trip. It was time to get more.This time, however, I opted for that pack of 3 bars of Original Irish Spring. Yes, I'm being frugal as much of that precious liquid escaped to the shower floor.However, the fragrance of the bar soap is not the Irish Spring Original. Not even close. Yes, it's the same striations of various green hues. And it's a pleasant fragrance which I really don't know how to describe.My suspicion? Colgate-Palmolive got their perfume batch from one of their other products mixed in with the Irish Spring.
POSITIVE	Seems to be a quality product and has worked well for me. I had been leaving it on all the time, and the transmitter gets hot. I also noticed I would get some random loud static on occasion. Turning it on only when I'm going to use it does seem to prevent this (so far), but is somewhat inconvenient.
POSITIVE	I'm not sure what the reasoning behind the $73 price tag on this FORMERLY rare EP is but...Go to the HEM official website (google is your friend) and click 'store'. There, I'm Talking With My Mouth - the actual EP - is $8.00Best part is that you are buying it through HEM's own label so they get nearly if not actually all of your money.Just thought you might want to know.
POSITIVE	This book is extremely useful for the reader as a book for themselves and for their clients. I highly recommend this book.
NEGATIVE	I bought this product for a friend in Pakistan. I was appalled at how long the shipping was projected to take (more than a month) but my friend reports that he never recieved the cd. If shipping to Pakistan is such a risky propostion I think customers might be told that Amazon cannot assure us that a prodect will arrive.
POSITIVE	I really like LRD's remix of Cassius's song Feeling for you and this CD is the same style. It does have eighties style digitized rythm and I think its sneaky for him to pose as a French guy (though maybe thats those badboys at Astralwerks) but its a cool disc. You could definitely do worse. Also, it is consistent. So if you like a song you heard somewhere by him, you'll like the album.
NEGATIVE	Total waste of money if you are using for golf. This unit that I purchased will give false readings on yardage and sometimes will not give yardage. Sent it back to Bushnell and they sent it back to me and said nothing was wrong. Save your money and buy a good rangefinder
POSITIVE	"I first saw this film as a little girl, and I've watched it probably dozens of times since then. I have the dialogue almost memorized--there are so many classic lines! (""I'll teach you law...western law!"") The acting is great, and though it's a serious film about serious subjects, there's a lot of humor. But at the same time, it gives you a lot to think about.Kudos to Amazon for making this available free through their streaming Prime movies program."
NEGATIVE	So here's the formula gang...fake rage + corporate financial backing - talent\intelligence= lots and lots of yo money in these posers pockets
NEGATIVE	"He wrote a long essay about it, and condemned it for being an ""unmoral"" (as opposed to ""immoral"") book. If he used the adjective ""brilliant,"" it was probably in a negative way. Believe me, he was no fan of the author or of this particular book!"
POSITIVE	Phase 10 is a great family fun game--enjoyable for 7 year olds on up. There's no skill required, and no real strategy.The idea is to finish one phase and then get rid of the cards left in your hand. Be the first to finish all 10 phases and win the game.The typical game lasts about an hour.To start each player is dealt 10 cards and they all work on Phase 1, which is getting two sets of three similar cards. three 5's and three 12's, for example. Once you've laid down your phase you're ready to discard your cards and move on to next phase. You can play for points or play to be the first one out.It's a good game to teach younger children sequences, and counting; and challenging enough to keep kids of ages interested.Since it's a card game, the durability isn't long lasting--depending upon how rough you are with cards. The tin helps store the cards.Easy to pick up, and entirely fun.
POSITIVE	I liked this book because it contained both simple and harder patterns. The simple ones are really good for beginning knitters. Although I have only made two of the designs in this book, I plan to make the other patterns as gifts.
POSITIVE	"This is a good continuation of the original series. The lower budget hurts, but the new animation studio did a good job of capturing the feel of the original series and they continued the storyline. This time around the series has a stronger story arc and the focus is more on Triella. It's not a black and white world, as evidenced by the treatment the three main ""villains"" get, both in terms of air time and character development. It's hard to find Anime that rises up to the level of both of Gunslinger Girl series. Just as with the first series, while violence is a part of the series, it's the characters and the character development that makes this such a great series."
POSITIVE	My teeth are hard to whiten. I really like Opalescence because it does a good job in a relatively short time. I was using the 5% before, and for me the 10% is even better because I only need about 2 nights, 3 maximum, for a really good whitening job, then can go months with just a one-night tune-up now and then. So it's lasting me even longer. Good product!
POSITIVE	"Even if you're not a country fan, Mel's music goes down easy. ""Coca-Cola Cowboy"" and ""Commercial Affection"" I especially like. This one's worth the money. I just wonder what compilation I'll find ""Send Me Down to Tucson"" on, you know, from one of the bareknuckle Clint Eastwood movies. Try this one; you'll like it."
NEGATIVE	"It still amazes me that those who consider themselves to be Christians (after Christ; not Moses or Solomon, etc.)still keep some of what is ""called"" Biblical law. The Old Testament is a history book which is to lead a believer to the NEW Covenant which has put the Old Covenant (Old Testament) to rest. I shudder to think that the author of this booklet believes that Christ wants them to hit babies and children. Christ taught discipleship. The word 'disciple' means to bring one along side and teach them by instruction and example; not hitting or any other form of violence. I pray that the readers of such books and booklets will follow the example of Christ rather than an outdated, fulfilled, and cast-off Covenant which is no longer in effect.

POSITIVE	We broke the handle on the original and this purchase was a replacement. This carafe does an excellent job keeping our coffee hot.
POSITIVE	Royal rumble 1996 was not the greatest royal rumble ever by far but it was good.Jeff Jarett vs. Ahmed JohnsonThis was a pretty good opener, wasn't to long but when Jarret puts the guitar through ahmeds head, a peice of wood gets stucj in his head!Tag champs Smoking Gunns vs. Body DonnasWasn't that great. It bored me.Intercontinental champ Razor Ramon vs. GoldustPretty good match...some slow spots but good.Royal RumblePretty good.......not great because of the people that were in it. There were only like 6 big name guys and everyone else were no names but it was entertaining.World Champ Bret Hart vs. UndertakerBest match of the night. If the iron man match hadn't of happend than this would of been match of the year. Fans were in it and it was back and forth. Ending sucked. Undertaker had the match won.There were about 1000 empty seats.
POSITIVE	The Hip Pocket Guide is a great portable reference for HTML 4. I wouldn't recommend it as a beginner's first or only book, but for someone who knows the basics, it is extremely helpful. Whenever I need a reminder about what attributes I can use with a particular tag, this is the book I refer to.It is especially great for the web designer who must travel throughout the day. Whether I'm working on my pages at home, or teaching HTML at work (USF - Tampa), I've got this guide with me.
POSITIVE	"Read the reviews before purchasing this book but really did not know what to expect. Boy did I enjoy this read. Amazing how this book was written ages ago but the principles still apply today. The world works the way it does all due to propaganda. Unsure as to how we can really evolve out of this way of thinking/operating though as propaganda is very deeply ingrained into the way society has worked for decades.Have always felt that something was off in the world. Now I can understand why. Case in point, we really do not live in a ""Democracy"", we just think we do. Everyday choices have already been made for us (yup, read the book). I appreciate how this book really helped me put things into perspective from a business/marketing/world order standpoint."
POSITIVE	I have been searching for the docking station in other stores and this was by far the best value. I have been using it for a few weeks now and it has been very practical. I recomend it.
NEGATIVE	The problem with the instant cold pack is not that it doesn't get very cold instantly after activation, but the length of time it maintains its icy coldness. It's about 5 minutes and frankly, if you have pain or swelling that you are attempting to address, this doesn't do it. Seller should indicate in product specifications how long it is cold after activation.
NEGATIVE	"I wish I saw this video review someone did on youtube before I bought these.[...]If the link doesn't work, search youtube for ""snap caps best & worst""I didn't even open the package, going to resell locally since it will cost me about 1/2 as much as they cost, to ship them back.Went to MidwayUSA.com and bought the Tipton snap caps. I don't want to dig out aluminum shavings from my gun, as the above video shows these A-Zooms will do."
NEGATIVE	Sorry, but I don't understand how this book has gotten any good reviews. It is pure fluff. The writer seems to be more of a 'motivator' than someone who can actually accomplish anything on his own. He fails to address simple issues is a straightforward manner.Simplistic writing and convoluted logic. Save your money and buy Gary Keller's Millionaire Agent book. It is far better at showing you how to leverage your time and resources into very large returns. This author talks about beating the average income of $17,000/year. Keller teaches you how to maximize your potential and become financially independent.
POSITIVE	Great Album with tons of emotion and non of that POP garbage. I only wish their music was more available in the US because when they do break out here they will be a smash hit.
POSITIVE	This movie was the instight to relationships everyone needs to have. This book was as true as it gets. Brittney Murphy and Ron Livingston were wonderful. Holly Hunters character was great too but you wanted to smack her in the end. This is a movie about a girl who's life was being lived by example of her mothers. She ends up in love with a wonderful guy and he ends up leaving on a business trip. With the coxing of her peers she decides to check into his past relationships and starts to nose around in his palm pilot for insight to his past relationships. Its funny how she comes to a relaziation about her relationships and relationships of others. This movie could not be more true to fact. Loved every minute of it. Sound track was wonderful and made the movie. Three cheers for little black book. Watch this movie today and may you find the perfect relationship.
POSITIVE	David Weber and John Ringo have done it again. They have produced a nice, tightly (and seamlessly) plotted book that makes one read it from cover to cover in the shortest time one can. I read it in one glup and all I can say is: Thank you, gentlemen. Bravo!
NEGATIVE	This pizza stone was used only 3 times. It was always placed on a cold grill or in a cool oven and allowed to come up to temperature and cool down inside oven or on grill. After the third use the stone split in two. Do not recommend this item.
NEGATIVE	Starting homeschooling my 4, 8 & 6 year olds and was wondering what to teach when they need to learn things and where can I find this information. This book did not contain that information is lists books and other information that you can find your self online or in basic homeschooling books. So its just sitting on my shelf collecting dust.
POSITIVE	I blew off a full day of work just to finish this book, and it was well worth it. A fun and scary roller coaster of a ride. Can't wait for the sequel. Haven't anticipate one this much since I was a kid waiting for Return of the Jedi.
POSITIVE	"any cd of rita""s i have attempted to purchase! she is awesome, Holy Spirit led and her music is of the same!very pleased!joann"
NEGATIVE	Wow, you have some anger issues going on with Bosnians and Croatians. Of course you don't want to admit that the Serbs were the bad guys. That is human nature. And if you feel comfortable living in your own little world of dreams, then go ahead. The rest of the world knows what went on. Sweet dreams amigo.
POSITIVE	"This CD is great. I especially like the song ""Layne"". If you are a Alice in Chains fan, you would love this song. I think that it is great. The entire CD has such a great sound to it. You have to go out and buy it. It is definitely worth it!! A+++++++++"
POSITIVE	Normally, you have to appreciate British humor to watch these kind of shows. The IT Crowd is pretty much a combination of Dilbert and Office Space that delivers alot of dry humor. If you work in IT... You MUST watch this show.
POSITIVE	"""This is a great way to introduce scripture to very young children. Their sense of discovery is excited by the flaps in the Bible. My grandson loves it!"
NEGATIVE	I bought this shredder last year and it has been a big dissapointment. The unit has a safety feature whereby it will only run if the top is pushed all the way down onto the basket and slips over a small metal piece. this metal piece is GLUED onto the interior side of the basket. it is very vulnerable to being knocked off because you can't see it when you push the top on (and they paid engineers to design this?). if that 2 cent piece falls off, the shredder is useless. the auto-on feature on my machine also didn't work, shredding continuously regardless of whether there was paper in the feed or not. and needless to say, it could not handle more than two or three sheets at a time, way below what is advertised.
POSITIVE	I picked this book while on a biking tour of the southwestern part of Ireland. I really enjoyed the author's comments on the country. He spends most of his time in the western part of the Ireland and it directly related to my trip. He is English and some of the language was a little foriegn to me (I live in the US). He has a good mix of humor and insight. Well worth reading for anyone visiting or interested in this part of Ireland.
NEGATIVE	I purchased sunglasses which were suppose to be polarized, but they weren't. I sent them back to the seller who returned the money to my account. The seller tested them and agreed they were not polarized. I am waiting on the return postage money to be credited to my account.
NEGATIVE	When it works, this humidifier does a wonderful job. However, at least once a week it goes on strike. Since we first got it my husband has been dutiful in taking it apart and cleaning it thoroughly. Sometimes it decides to start working again, sometimes it doesn't. Sadly, my husband (who is the most laid back human you will ever meet) decided to have it out with humidifier after spending 30 minutes cleaning - only to have it refuse to get back to work. He dropped a punch on it (which makes me laugh now that I think of it) and it's now headed to the humidifier graveyard. Good riddance.
POSITIVE	Received it the next day, Thanks Prime! Excellent product, fit was exact match for OEM location. Seems to be doing the job well, my truck passed emissions testing without issue. Sound and performance seem to match stock parts, overall a great buy.
POSITIVE	I have always been a fan of Ed's, I play the guitar, so how can anybody give a bad review to anything Ed does. He is the best. There is more envy involved than anything else, when people give a bad review to this album. It will stand the test of time. It changed the sound of the 80's
NEGATIVE	this book is nothing but pages of names,names of gemstones,names of animals,names of pagan origin,names,names and more names...but really hardly anything about those names just brief paragraphs of overall origin but nothing on the individual names listed..it was a boring book, plain and simple and a disappointment to say the least.
POSITIVE	"There's not a whole lot to say about a doughnut cutter, but this one works well--the cutting edge is sharp and accurate, the product arrived promptly and carefully packaged, and the overall cutter is deep enough to handle highly risen doughs. Maybe the distance from the inside cutter (the ""hole"") to the outside edge could have been a little wider, but overall, I'm happy with it."
POSITIVE	In general it is nice ball, but skin is not so solid. Significant crack appears after first use, though this does not really affect usage.
POSITIVE	"This disk simply goes beyond excellent vocals- It encorporates orchestra and synth masterfully into a music package that stands out from the rest of anime music. I bought this originally for the first track: ""Unyielding Wish"", damn good in itself, let alone the rest of the CD. A must purchase for any anime music library."
POSITIVE	I find this book very interesting,I am Danish but a friend in USA told me about the book, I might buy more books about The Austin's
NEGATIVE	A few good wave shots intermingled with useless airel views of waves (too high), also some seals, birds, a cow, and a train (close up). This is not the relaxing wave video I had hoped it would be, the music is high pitched twanging, so it is better with wave sounds, when there are any. Very disappointed.
POSITIVE	Heard one of their songs on iHeart radio. Purchased the album based on other reviews and I have not been disappointed. My only regret is that I'm hearing about them now.
POSITIVE	I am strictly a beginner with no previous knowledge of any of the forms of Japanese, so this book was confusing at first. Once I got the hang of the book's method of teaching, the chapters went by a little smoother.I get the feeling of a stern, business-like presentation of the material, and in fact, the author does mention that his original goal was to teach IBM employees...
POSITIVE	I like the fact that this crib has the cabinet below to store dolls and accessories. Size seems to be just right, and my daughter likes it.
POSITIVE	Have a 1990 toy. celica gt with the org. rear main seal. Put 1 bottle in with a fresh oil change..The car does mainly short trips, and for first 2 weeks really no difference, but then after taking a few highway hour or so trips, it worked by the 3rd week...Rear main seal leak stopped and its been about 2 months now..So I think the key is highway speed trips to really get it to work and heat it up.....I've tried them all, and nothing worked or even came close to AT-205, some even made it worse....Will change the oil next week and use another bottle and see what happens...So far so good....
POSITIVE	I had my doubts about the quality because of the low price, but I couldn't be more pleased. Even the included hardware was surprisingly far nicer than expected.
POSITIVE	I bought the set (salt and pepper) for my wife as a gift and she was thrilled. The quality is there, the finish was excellent. I wish the handles fit more snugly but they do what they advertise. Light years over plastic parts grinders.
POSITIVE	"The thing about Spencer novels is the presentation of the main characters; Susan, Hawk, and especially Spencer are cool. Because the books are written from a first person perspective, there is a special opportunity for audio books. Burt Reynolds takes advantage of that opportunity. His character portrayals are excellent.Reynolds delivery is outstanding. He doesn't try too hard. His timing is great. Sometimes it's almost like he is talking specifically to me, not to a room of people - like he is responding to my feedback or something! He portrays the characters as I imagined them before I ever listened to a Spencer audiobook. (I didn't watch the TV series more than a couple times.)Even without Reynolds, ""Chance"" is an interesting story, with a good balance between action & dialog, plot & character development. With Reynolds, it is six stars!"
POSITIVE	"Golders Green, a northern Jewish suburb, is where Badfinger used to live, a place where Ham could record his little songs on a Revox tape. Some of the songs the guy wrote are amazing. He was defiently one of the best songwriters to come out of Britain. His material on Badfinger's ""Straight up"" and ""Wish you were here"" are 100% superb. Perfect pop songs. ""Golders Green"" is a really good album, it shows Ham's songwrting and performance talents. ""Dawn"" is a beutiful Psych ballad,""Makes me feel so good"" could have been easily 'The first Power Pop anthem' if was released at that time. The rest is quite the same, Very Mccartney in total, similar to Mcca's early solo albums, sometimes even better."
POSITIVE	This movie was a great. what make it better when you see on HD-player. very funny and I do recommend it to anyone a nice familymovie.
NEGATIVE	"I'm totally disappointed with this toy & so is my son! An uncle purchased this for him for Christmas & he was so excited because he loves the ""Cars"" movie & all of his other ""Cars"" toys. Stick to Hot Wheels people! This toy won't stay together, doesn't look like the picture on the box when it is assembled & won't work properly. I've read other reviews & I'm glad to hear that some people's children enjoy the toy but the one we have is HORRIBLE! I may try to return it because it's THAT BAD!!!"
NEGATIVE	i brought this coffee maker last year , and last year i had to send it back because it would not finish brewing. so they made send back the broken one and a couple of weeks later i received it, well the coffee maker is not working again , and its the same thing the dang cofee maker will not finish brewing, its like i have to turn it on 4 times for it to finish brewing. i really think for the price of this maker we should not be having these kind of problems, so i would say to anyone thinking of buying this dont!!!look elsewhere , its not worth it.
POSITIVE	Great volume of knowledge and detail. My elderly parents are already showing signs of much-improved health. Mother (a diabetic) has dramatically decreased her blood sugar readings. The whole family is very grateful for this life-extending program!
POSITIVE	"""Crank"" is directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. Chelios (Jason Statham) is a hitman who has been injected with a drug that will stop his heart, and the only way to fight the drug is to maintain a high level of adrenaline. Chelios then goes on a rampage hunting down the gangsters who did this to him. This film has a frenetic style of fast clips, and an almost montage style of filmmaking that reminded me somewhat of Oliver Stone's film ""Natural Born Killers"". Everything about the film is geared towards a hyper-realism. This is a brilliant film that never slows down. Buckle up!This film is presented with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and in 7.1 PCM Audio (uncompressed) or 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround EX Audio in English with Spanish subtitles. The soundtrack is loud and clear and one of the best to test your system with. Crank was filmed with high definition cameras and its high clarity images and knock out color and contrast reflect this."
POSITIVE	Usually I'm not into the whole go girl thing, ever since the pop princess's came out and ruined the whole girl power thing for me but, damn is she incredible. If you want chicks who can play your instruments and have the talent OF KEEPING THEIR CLOTHES on this is the CD for you. The depth that she has for her age is incredible!
NEGATIVE	This product is a fine product, unless you actually want to use it. The top thumb nut is capable of sliding up and down the bolt making it impossible to use as intended. I will not make the purchase again.
POSITIVE	"Just 2 of his routines on this video are funny enough to rate it 5 stars, the ones about the prison, and the one about the mob. If I ever need a laugh, I go directly to this concert, or Richard Pryor ""Live""."
NEGATIVE	"Christopher Hitchen's book ""No One Left To Lie To"" could have been great. I've always enjoyed his entertaining style and trenchant analysis in Vanity Fair. This book, however, is a huge disappointment. There may be insightful commentary buried in here, but it is under literally bucketfuls of invective, name-dropping, and self-aggrandizing. Hitchens clearly lacks emotional distance from his subject and he comes off petulent and mean-spirited. While this book is quite short, the reading of it was as arduous a process as picking up War and Peace in the original Russian. NOT recommended."
NEGATIVE	I bought these train cars to go on our Thomas & Friends train track. We also have the compatible Melissa and Doug train track. The Zoo cars are much too small to fit on either track set.
NEGATIVE	ESTE CD ESTA MUY POBRE DE MUSICA ROCK-CONTIENE MUCHOS COVERS, POR FALTA DE TALENTO, Y CREATIVIDAD, NO ES DE ROCK, ES DE TROPIROCK- JA! JA! JA! MANA NO SOBREVIVIRA MAS!!!
POSITIVE	The recoloring is fantastic. DC went all out with this one - no cheap corner cutting with the quality of the binding, paper, color, or size. Wonderful.
NEGATIVE	The mirror is great if it works. It quit lighting up a month after I bought it. Other reviews had the same complaint. I should have listened and not bought it.
POSITIVE	I bought this after my old shower head needing retiring. I was looking for one of these dual sprayer type shower heads and I liked the look of this one. The reviews all looked good, so I went for it. It installed in minutes and works like a charm. There is a small amount of leakage when turning the water off, but goes away in a few seconds. I've never met a shower head that didn't have this problem. I like being able to set it so that the water still comes from the stationary head while the other head is in use. The only minor issue here is that the pressure isn't quite what I hoped for and there aren't many settings, but that will just take a little getting used to. I really like it and think I may install another one in our second bathroom. I would definitely recommend this shower head to others.
POSITIVE	HIS SHOW IS GREAT A LTTLE OFF COLOR BUT NO MORE THAN NORMAL DAY CONVERSATIONS ON TV BUT THE MINI VIDEO OF JEFF MAKING THE DUMMY SHOWS OFF HIS REAL TALENTS
POSITIVE	these guys rock. this cd is so awesome, it's got the combo of singing and screaming. sweet guitars and melodies. no one should live without this cd. it's definetly a top 5 of all time.
NEGATIVE	The seller sent me completely wrong book (wrong title, wrong ISBN), made me pay to ship back and only will refund book amount.
NEGATIVE	Can someone explain to me why these batteries are offered as a dual purchase with a collar that uses completely different batteries??.Thanks Amazon, really helpful that one!
POSITIVE	I have not yet had the opportunity to read Mr. Harrison's first book (The Singing Underneath), but I hope to at some point in the near future. As for Feeding the Fire, like his second book (Signs of Arrival) it is a fine collection of poems drawn from poignant memories and touching observations with exquisitely placed dashes of wit. Harrison has the keen ability to synthesize experiences and feelings into a coherent fabric of verse that is easily read. The book was also beautifully produced (particularly the hardback) by Sarabande Books.
NEGATIVE	This is by far one the worst books I've ever read, it was a waste of about four hours of my life. The characterization is decent, but with the differences between them, it's hard to believe that they are friends in the first place. Also, the idea of the bulimic girl who is best friends and best enemies with this spoiled b*tch is just ludicrous. If I were you, and I had a second chance, I would avoid this book at all costs. Read The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants instead.
NEGATIVE	I purposely paid extra to expedite shipping of a book. The two other books that I ordered on the same day have been received, BUT THIS SELLER STILL HAS NOT SHIPPED, he has sat on it since Friday morning, it is now after the work day on Wednesday - 4 entire business days and a weekend in between.THIS SELLER IS UNRESPONSIVE - it is sad that I have to go through means of a review because THE SELLER HAS NOT RESPONDED TO TWO EMAILS. Regardless of what shipping method, it is inexcusable, lazy, arrogant, and discourteous to not ship anything within at least a few days time.DO NOT USE THIS SELLER.
POSITIVE	I love pretty much all of his writings, so I may be a bit biased, but this is a great get back story and has all the nice nitty gritty details to keep your attention
POSITIVE	"I love these guys! I owned both of these on vinyl and wore them out. I also wore out the cassets I made of these recordes. Yes I am old. I played these records extensively on my radio show in college. Nothing quite gets the blood flowing like ""Pat Brown"" or ""Anarchy Burger"". They displayed a great amount of humor in their country western flavored song that talks about ""all the girls in thier tight fitting jeans so they don't look fat"" I'm so old I forgot the name of the song.I still bust out in stitches everytime I think about ""Viking Suit"" from the ""when in Rome...""I am buying now because these are timeless clasics. Besides one of the guys in the band has my first name. Nils"
NEGATIVE	These knives look great and even have a nice feel to them, but they cut like a hacksaw. The serated edge is such that the knives rip the meat apart rather than slice through it. At this price, they are sufficient to use at a beach house, or take on a camping trip, but I wouldn't use them at a dining table with a tablecloth.
POSITIVE	We got this for our van and we are loving it! The kids can watch the same movie or two separate movies. Each player has its own color coded remote. I would like to get the adapter to hook it up to the van stereo because it is too quiet for my son with hearing problems.
NEGATIVE	hey for all you older people out there im not hating on this movie i just think it was a lil slow oh who am i kiddin!this movie is good for helpin u get to sleep.i mean i geuss there cudd have been some funny jokes that i didint understand or no one under 35 cudd understand.Jack nicolson can be rele funny like in ANGER MANAGEMENT but this movie is for old people. its about a older man who dates girls under 30 and he happens to date the daughter of the single old lady who writes poems. the daughter break up with jack bcuz hes too old and her mom needs sum1 and she thinsk they should hook up and they do and you get to see a 57 year old lady copmpletely naked !!! yes evrything shows even though its rated pg 13 all this movie gave me was nightmares from taht nude scene THANK YOU
NEGATIVE	I ordred this grill brush on October 2, 2006. I never received it upon email, after email from Amazon that it was back ordered. After Christmas I received an email stating my order could not be processed as there was no product to provide.
POSITIVE	"A real treat to finally hear all of those Danny Janssen classics in their entirety. Plus, Jimmy Reed's ""Pretty Mary Sunlite"" is worth the cost of the whole cd. I've been singin' that damn tune since I was 6. The early songs are much better than the later Scoob tunes. Although, ""Scooby's Mystery Mix"" is pretty incredible - matching a vocal collage from the cartoon with electronic/rave music. A must have for any true Scooby fan."
POSITIVE	i'm glad the negative reviews didn't scare me away from this book. it was a great read as well as an invaluable source of information. it directs you to the exact resources you need to buy or not buy, how much they are, where to get them, when to use them, what to pay attention to or skip, and it overall lets you know what to expect from the unexpected. in response to the negative points of contention i noticed... 1. it's over 800 pages: thank you! 2. the author is a hater: i would say a critic of legal education and his points make sense. whatever his beliefs, his advice is sound. 3. it really doesn't help: the book is supposed to be an informational tool to help structure a path toward educational success, not take your exams for you.law school is a huge investment for me, and thanks to this book i'm excited to take the next steps.
POSITIVE	Everything works like it's supposed to and it was sent on time. I have no complaints and I will definitely buy from them again.
NEGATIVE	I bought this book to find out how to print variables from a javascript to a web page. Sounds simple, right? Sounds like page #1, right? Not only does this book never tell you how to do this simple and very basic operation, it pretends that no such thing could ever be expected from a book on scripting! It tells you how to print variable to popup widows and that's it. It pretends that this is all the output any person using JavaScript would or should ever need. They never address output to the web page itself. Never even mention it. Not once. That's just what I need to do with my arrays, print them to a popup alert window. I would have appreciated at least a small message as to *why* they don't tell you about such simple and basic stuff. This book is really pretty bad. I suggest you try another one on JavaScripting. It's bad, and it's disingenous.
NEGATIVE	Everything about this movie is cliche.2 dimensional characters, laughable security at a supermax facility and predictable story line.Do yourself a favor and skip this.
NEGATIVE	Look...I've learned, to enjoy any of these Hollywood Blockbusters, it is wise to accept a certain amount of movie logic. Without doing so, movies can drive one crazy on common since issues alone. Since I've taken on the philosophy of allowing some movie logic breathing room and without questioning it's common since, I have truly enjoyed movies much more. After all, movies are an escape right? So a little silliness is okay.With that said, The Core is not only full of movie logic, The Core is full of lame twists and turns that fall short of any enjoyable entertainment! While the special effects are fantastic, they cannot carry this film to quality movie status.I tried very hard to like this movie. In fact, I really wanted to like it because I love end of the world movies. I just can't, in good conscience, recommend this film. It's lame...to THE CORE.
POSITIVE	Vitamin C with mineral ascorbates is gentler on my stomach. It's been said that without minerals, vitamins are virtually useless. Granted, the pills are too huge for children to swallow, but they test the gag reflex wonderfully. I bow my head slightly and the pills slide right down.
NEGATIVE	This is garbage. Unless you have a gigantic forearm and a severely deformed hand, this thing will not fit you. Terrible quality, don't waste your time or your money on this nonsense
POSITIVE	"This was the first peek at Bigod 20 that most of the mainstream saw. They have several remixes of the title track, ""On the Run""; however none of these mixes have that stale redundancy that often brings down dance singles. The cover of ""Like a Prayer"" makes a great B-side. In my opinion, that is the best that song ever sounded"
POSITIVE	An excellent piece of history about one of the worst U.S.natural disasters. It's full of great photos, many never published before (where did he get all of them!?)of the time before and after the quake. My favorite thing about the book is that he tells numerous personal stories of the people affected, stories that make you really think about how YOU might have reacted to such a disaster. It's amazing to think how the good people of Berkeley, right across the bay, managed to do such good work to provide for thousands of San Francisco refugees without any government help!(O.K., now you know my political leanings). Compare Katrina now to 1906 reactions. read this book!
NEGATIVE	We had a problem with the phone. Tried to return it and was told to contact GE. Called and went through the maze of selections. NONE for cordless headsets. Tired to find speak to human selection. None. We gave up. WILL NOT BUY GE EVER
NEGATIVE	"Description states NO EXTRA""S! Back of case photo also shows no sign of extras! This set comes 4 discs in one case."
NEGATIVE	These are not 35's. We own 35's and these are about 3 inches too small no would say they are 32 inches. Very disappointed! 2 stars because the quality is great, but the missing 3 stars we because they are not as presented.
NEGATIVE	Satanists worship Satan, hence the name. The basis of witchcraft began in old Europe around the Black Sea circa 5000 B.C. It involved the first form of dance and prayer, and a very fat maternal figure. Our principals were set long before Christians invented Satan. If you want history read The Wiccan Mysteries. That's homework. You might want to take a closer look at the Horned God. You'll have a hard time making a vicious hell beast out of Bambie's Dad. Thankfully, George Bush has not yet succeeded at recalling the right to religious freedom. Ho-ya! And next time you accuse people of something put down your name coward.
NEGATIVE	If there was a 0 that's what this cd would be rated. I've seen them on the covers of magazines so i decided to check 'em out.....bad idea! These guys suck sooooo bad, I put the cd on my cd player and the first song sucked, then the second, same thing! The same thing happened on every track. This cd is a load of flamin' cr_p! The song names are cool but thats it. If you know what's best for you don't even think about purchasing this cd.
POSITIVE	Stewart O'Nan never fails to impress me. He tackles different themes, different eras, different everything in each book. This one, slim and incisive, is a masterpiece of understatement. The tale of Jacob Hansen's life and losses soon after the Civil War, when the town of Friendship is stricken by both a diphtheria epidemic and a raging forest fire, is exquisitely simple but remarkably powerful. I haven't stopped thinking about this book since I finished reading it. I marvel at how much O'Nan manages to convey without ever being explicit. Love, tragic loss, and survival against all odds are the interwoven strands of the theme. Life lessons compressed into one short book. This is a very special novel, written by a wonderfully gifted writer.
POSITIVE	"Buying an artist's first effort, especially one from a band that is not well known, can be risky. However, I find Muse's Shobiz to be a fairly consistent album and the band itself musically talented. You will not find the typical CD formula here, where 2 or 3 tracks are radio-worthy and the rest of the album is fluff or ""filler"" material. If you find yourself enjoying the sample audio, you can expect the same quality on all tracks. I hesitated using the term ""radio-worthy"" to describe Showbiz because these tracks will never ride the American airwaves. The only downside to Showbiz is that it's one of those albums you tend to get bored with if you listen to it too often. However, I just dusted mine off and am currently enjoying it again."
POSITIVE	Buju Banton can easily be considered the most influential dancehall artist of his time, and his albums have never failed to meet the expectations of his fans. This album certainly meets those expectations, there are some excellent compilations, such as teaser with Bounty Killah, and Wayne Wonder, but Buju has changed his style. It seems he's changed his style to fit mainstream dancehall, such as sean paul who has no talent. It's an amazing album but his style has change.
POSITIVE	This was also a christmas gift. The game has been played often and has been enjoyed. The graphics on the game are very good as long as you have the supporting graphics card.
POSITIVE	Every one who knocked this book is either a wanna-be or a REMF. Sure there were a few mistakes made in the book, but for the most part the book was factual, and very hard to put down once you starded reading it. My Unit Echo 75th Rangers worked with some of the Navy guys from My Tho. I would venture to say that each and everyone that did had a lots of respect for these guys. I would recomend this book highly. Roadrunner 6 Out
POSITIVE	There is just something so, well, captivating about Russell. This collection shows that powerful voice to its best as he belts out a number of classical and pop songs. His concerts also indicate why he is such a top star. The hand gestures, the distinctive way he moves on stage, his rapport with audience has made him a big star in England and Australia. This is one of those motivational collections that shows Britain's most unconventional classical singer in his tantalizing prime!
POSITIVE	"Adam Scott wasn't really on my radar but I caught him in the last Season 2 episode of Eastbound and Down. A couple nights later, ""The Vicious Kind"" was on one of my cable channels. Good God. He has such a delicate face, but with the facial hair, it seemed to help in changing his persona. Really good movie and he was smoking hot in it."
POSITIVE	A tad more violent than it needed to be, but this was a great continuation of the Firefly story. It answered many questions from the series and made the movie even more enjoyable. They pushed scientific possibility a bit far - but you're so busy enjoying the story and numerous surprises that you'll only realise it much later after the movie. Having seen the full series and movie now I hope they find a way to continue the story. If you enjoyed the story and humor of the series, you can't go wrong with the DVD.
POSITIVE	The reviews above are clearly inadequate. Judging by the fifth edition, this is an excellent and comprehensive book. Though it is best designed for teachers, it can be used by someone with a talent for persistent self-study.
POSITIVE	Was really impressed on the very first listen to this album. Usually it takes a couple of listens for me to appreciate any album but this one hits me good everytime I've ever heard it. Sort of like the first time I heard Hair Of The Dog!!!(on 8-track)!!
NEGATIVE	This product supposedly works with a Samsung R580 notebook, but does not meet the specifications required for the notebook. We will see how they do with returns.
POSITIVE	I have always been interested in the sports buiness industry and wanted to gain more insight into the world of a sports agent. Upon recommendation from [...] writer Darren Heitner I purchased a copy of this book and found it to be very informative. It helps explain the industry to young athletes so they know what to expect when dealing with potential agents. I would consider this a must read for any athlete involved in collegiate sports or for anyone who hopes to work in the industry.
NEGATIVE	I bought this set for my daughter's violin. Her teacher made us buy another set because this set is made of steel. She warns that steel strings for small size violins don't sound right, but a friend has already replaced the strings for us. We are keeping them as a backup only.
POSITIVE	I wouldn't say that I am an Elvis Presley fan, but I do enjoy listening to him sing the songs that are in this album.
NEGATIVE	I used this for school for a while and for a camping trip. We hiked maybe two miles and it dug into my shoulder the entire time. It wasn't loaded heavily either, there just isn't a lot of padding on the straps.
NEGATIVE	Save your money! I had big expectations for this DVD, but it fell very short. I expected some details about towing a dinghy, such as: what to expect in various situations, types of towbars and advantages of each type, types of supplemental braking systems and advantages of each type. After I received and watched this DVD, I was able to find more information on U-tube.
NEGATIVE	"im not just talking about music, this band is the worst thing in the world. they are unbelievably uncreative, and the lead singer sounds like hes having an asma attack. this band puts u in a depressed boring mood, but not like nirvana, this is in a bad way. they are quite possibly horrible songwriters. they copy nirvanas every chord, but change it a little, which makes their songs that horrible. id rather look at that little boys ass on the cover, than actually take the cd out and listen to it. do not waste your money. hell, dont even waste space on your hard drive downloading these guys. they make linkin park seem average. i cant wait until the band gets in a plane accident or something. i honestly dont know how anyone could enjoy listening to these guys. i think im gonna go listen to some limp biskit to get ""she hates me"" out of my head."
POSITIVE	This is very good, particularly the Australian railroad trip portion. The Canadian and South African portions were not quite up to the standard of quality provided for the Australian part.
POSITIVE	"Go to your local Fantasy Gaming store, and get two jars; one will be called ""Smelly Primer"", the other is ""Mithril Silver"". Get a VERY small-bristled brush to apply primer first, then MS after it dries.Result? A dead-on-PERFECT replica of the Phase Pistol; just brush on LIGHTLY around the orange tip."
POSITIVE	Stargirl (Susan Caraway real name) after being most of her life in homeschooling going to a public school was weird for her. Once she got to Mica Area High she had every pair of eyes on her, used to wear long, pioneer-style dresses, played a ukulele in the halls and in lunch room, and carried her pet rat Cinnamon with her.She made people happy with most of her things after a while. Leo Borlock follows the unspoken rule at Mica Area High :don't stand out rule. But when Stargirl gets to him everything changes and Leo falls in love with her.This book is absolutely amazing this was one of my favorite books its a book that once you open you can't close.
NEGATIVE	It's a good thing I only paid $.01 for this! Even so, including shipping (which was nearly $4.00!!), this was a waste of money! I bought three, and the first one I used completely fell apart the first time I disconnected it from my iPhone! And why are iPhone chargers so SHORT??!!
NEGATIVE	This books was an extremely depressing book. Long and drawn out. Can all of this terrible stuff happen to these people. Does anything good ever happen. I will not buy any more of Steel's books after this one.
NEGATIVE	I'd like to warn those with sensitive teeth that this toothbrush, despite having extra soft bristles, exacerbates the problem of sensitive teeth. After using it twice a day for several days, my teeth, which are usually not too sensitive thanks to Sensodyne toothpaste, suddenly became extremely sensitive to hot and cold. Brushing also became unbearably painful, all of which subsided as soon as I went back to using my regular toothbrush. The company unfortunately would not issue a refund. If there had been a warning on the packaging regarding this issue, I would not have purchased the product. Buyer beware.
NEGATIVE	I agree with the previous reviewer (Nicole) that Obsessed is not Susan Andersen at her best. I bought it after having read reviews saying that the hero is difficult to like; I assumed that I would like the book anyway; I didn't. In my opinion, he is the weak point of the book. There's little suspense since the villain is given away early on; the sexual tension between the hero and heroine is difficult to sustain since he is so unpleasant. It's nice to know that Ms Andersen has improved so much.
NEGATIVE	So it was cheap, what did I expect? I cannot believe anyone ever made a sorrier machine than this piece of junk Fantom. The handle broke right away, the thing clogs up in 2 minutes or less, and it overheats in 5 minutes. Then it just shuts off. I get better results from my 15 year old dustbuster.
NEGATIVE	I did not like this movie at all.The animations were bad and the story the same.The movies conclusion or ending if you will, are OK and you will nok feel like you have any questions or that you did not get the entire story because of a cliffhanger.Give this 2 out of 5.
POSITIVE	Always wanted a nice compact portable dvd player,but these toys are usually too high in price..This player got it right on the money.The player has everything the high price ones have except the BIG screen..(If I wanted that,,I'd get a laptop computer with dvd),,,besides,,it's all about being compact..This player is fun to watch ..The screen is 4 inches but that's what you look for in a portable,,not a suitcase...Picture is clear,,disc does not skip..Where did these Initial guys come from??This is a high quality player for the price.With a pair of Koss 50 clip on or Panasonic RP-HS41 clip on headphones,the sound is unreal.
POSITIVE	Picked this book out of the blue. I love it so much I am now going to get the rest in the seires.
POSITIVE	i highly recommend this product. it was revealed to me by my esthetician and my skin has never been so healthy after using it post shower every day. this is all i use for skin care!
POSITIVE	No question that this is indeed the most concise, exciting single CD best-of covering Chicago's early hit period.Only two songs get the single editing treatment: Make Me Smile, and Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?The only really frustrating thing about this CD is that the group regained the catalog from Columbia. Since then, Columbia has been remastering their Greatest Hits line (B,S&T, Byrds, Donovan, etc) adding bonus tracks to boot.Chicago Records has to date failed to do the same. This means that this terrific Chicago best-of still has mid '80's sound quality.Suggestion: Chicago records remaster the catalog and add needed bonus tracks where available.
NEGATIVE	"Each season in this boxed set has numerous defective disks. Some freeze, some won't play at all. Very disappointing and frustrating. Amazon customer service was exceptional, however, and allowed the return of this defective product even after the 30-day refund period. Since then, I have ordered the ""Will and Grace 1-8 Seasons Bundle Pack"" from one of their independent vendors and am extremely pleased with the service and, more importantly, the quality of the dvds. The individual seasons just take up more room on the shelf ... small price to pay for having the shows play smoothly!"
POSITIVE	Saw these singers on some TV show (don't remember what) and theywere singing Unchained Melody. When they sing you feel the music inyour soul. Their voices are beautiful, clear and really romantic, every song is great. Not overly found of Simon of American Idol, but this time he struck gold when he discover this group. Can't wait for more song releases from them.
NEGATIVE	Found the picture for the most part was dark making it hard torecognize the players at times, especially in low light times.Other than that the sound was great.Although it was not the best quality picture, I decided to keepthe movie anyway.
POSITIVE	A picture is worth a thousand words, and in this moving DVD by the History Channel, the anguish and misery of the hard mining life is poignantly portrayed.
NEGATIVE	"It is fine to like this music, but to call it ""proto-punk"" is a total misnomer. That line you've heard about punk being about attitude, not music? It's a lie. Whatever lifestyle choices the term connotes, it most definitely does specify a type of rock 'n' roll, and ""The Music Power from Okinawa"" most definitely has nothing in common with it. Shonen Knife? Punk rock. REO Speedwagon? Not punk rock. Green Day? Perhaps a matter of opinion, but judging strictly from Amazon's sound clips, Shoukichi Kina makes them sound like the baddest, most strident, least socially acceptable punk band on earth. Sorry to rain on the parade, but I've read two reviews alluding to the ""punk"" nature of this album, and I have better things to do than to spend time previewing a mislabeled recording and be reminded that some ignorant music writers can't fathom the most obvious fine-points of pop-music analysis."
NEGATIVE	"Trite, cliched, a glorified harliquin romance. Nice if you're looking for something to pass the time or enjoy having your emotions easily manipulated by dripping sentimentality, but if you actually want to read something other then the standard soap opera fare then don't waste your time. I tried really hard to like this book, but it's predictablity and lack of depth (yes, it dealt with ""deep"" subjects but in the shallowist way possible) left me cold."
NEGATIVE	The wall charger didn't fit into the Black Jack phone easily and once it was in got very hot and didn't charge the phone. After that I didn't bother trying the rest of the items, was afraid they would damage the phone.
POSITIVE	"I had to read this Book for my Operation Management class at UNCC.I think this book was wonderful, since I enjoyed every page of. I believe that Eli Tolerate demonstrates his genius both as a thinker and as a teacher with ""The Goal"". As in any other well-written novel, The Goal examines issues in dispute which create conflicts. The operational concepts that he presents are revolutionary in their practicality and common-sense approach. This book is presented with a storyteller's passion for detail, while still driving the key learning points of the theory. This makes sticking with it to the end much easier, which is important, as several key concepts are not revealed until the final pages. Every organization can benefit from the concepts presented in ""The Goal"". Eli Goldratt has written a novel in which he provides an analysis of those concepts as applied in a fictional company. He has a cast of characters, a plot, and a context. He relies heavily on dialogue to advance the narrative."
POSITIVE	I have watched all year 1 episodes. The series was wonderfuluntil the Maya character was added - then I quit.(too many cooks)This was a very realistic break from other Sci-Fi shows. It focused more on reality: Capt.Kirk always met blue-green aliens, recited bad poetry, settled problems with phasers and was always 'scoring with women'.Cmdr.Koenig didn't try to 'score friends', he dealt with malfunctions, personnel problems,logistics & planning ,trying to make sure things ran right on Moonbase Alpha.This is a 'thinking mans' series...special effect junkies, go watch: Star Wars or something.
NEGATIVE	This product expired two months after I received it, allowing me to use only around half of what I purchased.
POSITIVE	clever and catchy. as funny as the tv show with new great characters that amaze! don't miss this film. it's a really great watch.
NEGATIVE	"Aside from typos and wrong answers, I have other issues with it. I doesn't explain concepts in a way that makes chemistry seem exciting; it attempts instead to couple chemical concepts with various human contexts (e.g., ""Properties of Gases -- and The Air That We Breathe""...it's like this for every chapter). There are no given pathways to external sources to learn more about a concept. All deep connections chemistry has to other subjects (and to the world in general) are lost.The only good thing about this book so far has been the fact that concepts and terms are clearly found in the page margins.Overall, this text book is pretty bad. (Also, the cover is ridiculous/stupid looking.)"
NEGATIVE	This is a stinky Aussie vampire/zombie movie that has little to offer. The premise sounds great but it's a no-budget sleepwalk and entirely without a point. A Viet Nam memorial is dynamited to make room for a Japanese theme park dedicated to cartoon character Robot Man....see, I told you it sounded great! Zombie vampire Viet Nam vets are then released and mosey all over the place doing very little, actually. A snore, a bore, off to the trade-in store.
POSITIVE	My wife and I are very happy with the Uniden TRU 5885-2 telephones and answering system. The sound on the handsets is like that on a wired phone; very clear. And they work flawlessly everywhere in our apartment. There is no loss of performance or static anywhere. Three speakerphones (each handset as well as the base) is a great convenience. Also,we find the ability to store 100 different numbers in each handset a plus; especially when they are used by two different people.The answering machine also has excellent sound and is easy to use. Was surprised to read that the message capacity is approximately ten minutes, and consider this a limitation. Most of the current machines have a capacity of 15 to 30 minutes. However, if we keep up with the answering machine on a daily basis, the ten minute capacity should suffice.
NEGATIVE	heavy handed and dull, the women were not likeable and neither was the guy, cute intro scene with the fluffy pink pen...that's about it.
POSITIVE	Product is extremely well made and functions perfectly. very solid and looks like ti will last for many years. I have used it for several months without a single problem. The only issue is that it does take a significant investment of your time to assemble. Plan on spending an entire Saturday to complete. Would have given it a definite 5 stars except for the assembly time needed.
POSITIVE	I have purchased this item a few times and love it! Its better than any other brand I have found for sure. We also use it on lots of other things besides steaks. I have used it on pork, chicken, veggies, etc. Wonderful flavors and not super salty like some of the other brands.
NEGATIVE	product made with cheap materials, skips, sound quality poor. this is the 2nd product purchased by this manufacturer and I would not buy again,
NEGATIVE	I bought this instrument aware of some of its faults. I'm used to new stringed instruments not holding its tune, but have never seen it untune right before my eyes. Stretching the strings didn't help at all. After giving up, I put it back in the included bag, figuring it would take a while until it could work as intended. A couple of hours later I heard it untune in the bag and then a bag; the bridge flew off. I guess that I'll get around to fixing her one day, and to be quite honest, I had her even less than that, but I'm really thinking of returning her despite the nice rich barritone sound I briefly heard before she literally flew apart.
NEGATIVE	The stylus on this pen does not work on my iPad. The pen is ok but I can get a pen anytime, anywhere. Don't waste your money!
POSITIVE	"I have used the StarMark Clicker for several years and I love it!It is not loud like the box metal clickers. I attach the clicker to a wrist band with a rubber band, so it hangs just right for me to access it quickly. I like the shape of the clicker; it fits comfortably in my hand.I always like to keep a few on hand to give to other training enthusiasts!I have 3 dogs and they love to see me get the clicker out. This means they get to ""work"" and clicker training makes learning fun!"
NEGATIVE	Twain spoils a promising premise with bloated preachifying, colorless prose, and an uneven, nigh-absurdist plot arc.
POSITIVE	"These are the Seventies in Spanish-America, and an explosion of writers surged. An ""all boys club"" (no Isabel Allende in those years) struggling for finding themselves, found that writing novels (or romances) will be, maybe, the best way. Mario Vargas Llosa, a then young and (very handsome) middle-class Peruvian wrote this satirical, funny, and witty novel where he laughs at himself, family values, modes and above all, men-women relationships.The setting: a radio station where the most popular genre were radio soap operas(""radio-novelas"" in Spanish, and from which he is taking the model for the construction of his writing).Interesting and moving, the afternoon strolls between Aunt Julia and Marito (he is her junior).If you are interested in Spanish Grammar (and/or culture) the usage of names and slang words at the diminutive should be noticed(Very Hispanic usage indeed). A reading in Spanish is highly recommended)."
NEGATIVE	Easy to follow recipes, but lacks the insight of other books, such as Dana Carpenter's book on low carb cooking.
POSITIVE	BOOT CAMP is absolutely the best SAT preparation book I have ever seen. Mrs. Manning's style of writing in BOOT CAMP is captivating. She writes as if she were speaking in person to the student. Her style used in presenting the material is so creative that the reader can't wait to get to the next page. All sorts of useful hints are given on how to master all of the material. When you buy this book, you will not be able to put it down, and you will be learning without even realizing you are. Mrs. Manning has a gift for bringing to the reader exactly what he or she needs in order to master the material given on the SAT. If you want to inspire yourself, while perfecting your SAT score at the same time, buy BOOT CAMP now. You will be very happy that you invested in such an incredible book.
NEGATIVE	This movie turns out to be just another romantic comedy with constant fat jokes. I thought Jack Black was hilarious in his other movies, especially High Fidelity, but he has nothing to work with here. The Farrelly Bros. have gone from doing great gross out humor to a sappy romantic plot here with virtually no laughs.
POSITIVE	I saw this movie at the New York Independent Film Festival and it totally lives up to its billing.....the pace is good, refreshingly the message is spared from being overkilled and Genius has to have one of the best endings to a film that I have ever seen....totally unexpected
POSITIVE	This book was wonderful. Most time travel just sorta have the people show up. They never seem confused or concerned. They act like it's an everyday occurence. Ms Lykins gives a whole new meaning to the word time travel. They are very innovative and the people in her stories act confused, concerned and scared. They pull from an inner strength they never realized they possesed to deal with the situation. If you enjoy time travel and a good love story, you'll love any of Ms. Lykins books.
POSITIVE	This is one of the best introductions to Buddhism available. The book begins with the life of the Buddha and then gives his basic teachings. The following chapters give an overview of the various schools and philosophies from a practice point of view. The chapters are written by great masters and practitioners of the various sects. If you could only have one text on Buddhism, this would be your best choice. For more reviews see the entry for the previous edition entitled ENTERING THE STREAM: An Introduction to the Buddha and His Teachings.
POSITIVE	You can love the fool and other sinners. This book explains how to see people as God does. Sinners needing to be saved. Learn to love them enough to speak the the truth to them. Helping them to see their sin and their need for God's forgiveness. I learned that I don't have to let other peoples sin,cause me to sin because I think I need to defend myself. The battle has been won already. Just let the fools make fools of themselves and through your love and grace they may recognize their foolishness leading them repentance. Great read and an encouragement to keep loving God and people.
POSITIVE	If you have a penchant for 18th century fashion this is the book for you. As I turned each page I was more and more enamoured with what I saw. The most delicious fabrics and designs, accompanied by authentic furniture and settings.You can just imagine Marie Antoinette swishing down the corridors of Versailles in one of these magnificent creations... absolutely wonderful!!
POSITIVE	Truly a cult classic. The unique style in how this film was presented was fabulous for its time. Seeing the cultural aspects of a different society was special indeed. Yet it cuts straight to our basic human instincts. The viewer cannot help but to be drawn into a whole new world. Light-hearted and insightful.
NEGATIVE	When we received the software it wouldn't work and we had to return it. There was no problem returning the item and getting refunded. The seller was very pleasant and easy to work with.
POSITIVE	I bought this for a diehard Steelers fan. He just loves it! It is great to have all of this Steelers stuff on DVD.
POSITIVE	The process went fine. The procuct was high quality. Shipping was fast and packed well
POSITIVE	Being a fan of Jons music for years, I felt the need to step in here and correct what a couple other reviews have said, that this set is a collection of poor quality mp3s...because it's not.It clearly states on the cd cover that it is a collection of the original Turquoise & Crimson mp3s that have been fully mastered. Which means they took the tracks and MASTERED them to cd quality. The mastering was NOT done from an mp3 source either, and anyone who bought the original mp3 downloads also knows this - as the original mp3s were of pretty bad quality. The tracks on this cd are not of bad quality & if you played the original mp3s side by side with this disc and couldn't hear the difference - you are freakin' DEAF!Great album, great songs. And like others have said - the tracks that later appeared on Nude are here in different versions. Definatley a must have for any VAST fan.
NEGATIVE	I've been using these speakers for about 2 weeks and haven't been impressed at all. It seemed like they were ok at first, but I periodically lose the signal to one of the speakers every few seconds or so. I've tried everything to resolve this by the way, taking out the batteries and plugging them into the power cord, even carrying them into the house, near the transmitter, adjusting the volume on the source. Not sure if cell phones are causing the interference but I'll probably return them soon.
NEGATIVE	I enjoy the Poker tables. The Crap table is way to slow. I understand this is a problem with most folks who purchased this game. I was disappointed with the new characters also. They removed the ability to trash talk to the other characters. All in all a real let down! I hear there is a patch that will make it all better...but i am not holding my breath.
POSITIVE	I converted my gas fireplace to a ventless system from the old vented style. I wanted to be sure that carbon monoxide level was not excessive or presented any health hazard. I wanted a CO detector with a digital readout. I researched many styles/brands and purchased the First Alert based on that research. It has worked very well and the price was very reasonable. I rate it as a very good decision!!
POSITIVE	Thank you for this movie and for the education it provides. We know that within Phase 2, FDA trials of treating childhood brainstem glioma, Antineoplastons hold a near 30% cure rate which means Antineoplastons are the first and only cures in medical history. Dr Burzynski can be reached at BurzynskiClinic.comI will be so happy when the FDA will allow people (especially those dying of cancer) the opportunity to choose Antineoplastons over radiation and chemotherapy.
NEGATIVE	I have read numerous wealth-building books. This one is worthless. It appears to be a hastily written collection of his personal stories which may or may not be applicable to you. He in several instances tells you how to bend the rules precariously, such as moving to other states to avoid bankruptcy and also tells you how to perform deceptive marketing. I have never, honestly never, felt so scammed by a book purchase, and wish I could give negative stars to warn the reader away. [SPAM ALERT I now get 10 to 20 spams a DAY sent to a unique email I used requesting my refund!]
NEGATIVE	If you enjoyed the original novel The Circus of Dr. Lao, you probably won't enjoy The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao. And if you didn't enjoy the novel, you probably won't like The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao. There is some great make-up in the old theatrical tradition, and the special features has a short documentary on the creation of make-up from the period of the film. However, this probably isn't worth owning the whole movie. Part of the problem is that the novel is a little transgressive, while the film transmits none of this quality. E.g., in the scene where the satyr seduces the school marm, the book is visceral, physical, and erotic, whereas the film is timid, clueless, and uncomfortable. This film could stand a re-make today, but they would ruin it with overdone CGI.
NEGATIVE	Leave it to the Japanese to do a better job in the DVD release of this epic WW2 film. It deserves much better than the poor VHS quality pan and scan vserion of this DVD by Hens Tooth. Both the Japanese release and the European release from Warner Brothers treat this film with the respect it deserves with a widescreen 1.85 crystal clear(at least compared to this job) picture and sound.Try renting the video and save your money for a future release in the way this film deserves to be done.
POSITIVE	I have a large family and both my wife and kids have used the Tung brush and LOVE it. Practical shape makes the rear of the tongue easy to reach and it's cost effective for the whole family. The mouth is the biggest germ gatherer and the Tung brush takes care of that issue plus bad breath gone all in 60 seconds.
POSITIVE	"There are few today who do not know the name Marc Jacobs. His clothing designs have won a loyal following who appreciate his flair and awareness of what becomes women. His designs are understated yet elegant, classic yet innovative.He reflects the same qualities in his fragrances. Of his latest, Blush, Mr. Jacobs said, ""My garden in Paris is permeated with the delicate scent of Jasmine. For me, it is a smell of simple and intense glory - nature in grand performance. I feel a connection exists between this rich flower and the innate power of femininity.""What words could better describe this fragrance? Star Jasmine, which is grown in China and is the richest form of Jasmine, highlights the scent augmented by Japanese Honeysuckle, soft musks and wood notes. It's dreamy, almost tender. Ultra feminine.The bottle is sleek, curved, a blush glass tone topped by a silver cap. Also included in the collection is Body Cream, Body Lotion, and Shower Gel."
POSITIVE	Wow I love these movies. We got them 2 weeks ago and we already watched 18 out of 42 dics. I would recomend these to anyone who like indians and good strong moral lessons.Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Complete Series Megaset,
NEGATIVE	It isn't the same color as pictured, highly disappointing, and sound quality sucks. Was trying to replace a lost par of skull candy headphones, these do not compare.
NEGATIVE	The left side stopped working within 3 months. I did not think that the sound quality was all that better than the $30 sound isolating earphones I bought almost a year ago. Oh, and the $30 earphones STILL work.
NEGATIVE	"Cheap mug, which if fine, it it actually worked. The inner plastic part slid right out of the metal cup as soon as I opened the box. Complete junk. The lid was actually decent, although the ""seal"" was a little more that a rubber band around the lid, with no channel to keep it in place."
NEGATIVE	WMF is a well known German manufacturer of steel products. This bread box is not made by WMF Germany and does not carry the WMF logo as shown in the photo. The box is made in China and does not meet quality expectations for WMF. It's on its way back now.
POSITIVE	when they split up in the plains when Lloyd drives the wrong way... and Harry gets mad at him and decides to walk homethis song is missing on the soundtrack... anyone know whats it called? or did i miss it on here? thanks.
NEGATIVE	Terrible, just terrible! Shows just how fearful the members of one party have become that they have to try to smear another candidate's good name and war record. Whatever happened to truth, honesty and fair play? It's a sad commentary on today's U.S. politics.
POSITIVE	Who says this is a ripoff? Everything is basically a ripoff of everything. This is a great Sci-Fi thriller with a ton of cool effects and great storyline. Must see!
NEGATIVE	Who would want to see Picnic in any other format than WIDESCREEN!!!This movie has not been available in a widescreen edition from Amazon for a LONG TIME......so when I saw they were now selling it I ordered it right away, just assuming it was widescreen. JUST A REMINDER TO CHK FURTHER DOWN THE PAGE AND READ ALL THE INFO!Hopefully they will accept the return and I'll go on waiting for it to be sold again in the widescreen format.
NEGATIVE	They were very cheaply made,Thank goodness they were just for little girls,I would have been embarrassed if I'd have ordered them for a gift for someone.I know I shouldn't expect alot for $5., but I'd have thought they'd be better than they were.
POSITIVE	This is my 2nd umbrella purchase from them. LOVE their customer service and love the product. They offer the friendly feel of your favorite neighborhood boutique, with the conveinience of online shopping. Highly recommend them.
NEGATIVE	I love All Clad cookware and all my pots/pans are All-Clad. But they are clearly taking advantage of their name with these measuring spoons. They are no different than any other stainless steel ones. Only 4 times the price. You are paying for the name ONLY.
NEGATIVE	"This book is not worth the time or expense. A top trauma surgeon suddenly discovers she can heal with her hands... She runs to hide her ""secret"". I am really tired of the ""small, petite woman"" and ""tall, Goliath of a man"" use also... So, this is the story of a supposedly intelligent woman who runs.... I feel bad even leaving a review because I couldn't finish the book but felt I needed to warn future shoppers."
POSITIVE	This book by Marsh Collier is as about as good as it gets. It is easy to understand. Though the book was written a few years ago, all of the information is still relevant. A few of the tools, etc. that are listed and described are revised on eBay's site, but the changes are rather minor and her how-to lessons are perfect. I highly suggest anyone wanting to buy and/or sell on eBay purchase this book. A++
NEGATIVE	"This book never could have been published without the Higgins Clark surname. I have not encountered such drivel since I read as a child. In fact, an acquaintance who read the same book thought that perhaps it had been written for ""young adults,"" however, I know of no teenager who would tolerate such inane dialog. I know I will never buy another. Grow up, Carol, and if there is a next time,try to write as an adult. Even the title is ludicrous!!"
NEGATIVE	I think I got through about 20 percent. Why couldn't I finish it? Maybe it was too real. Maybe too hopeless. Maybe lengthy conversations about love are just too boring. The characters annoyed me. She became increasingly insecure, constantly seeking reassurance, when she was separated from her lover. She whines, she pouts, she makes accusations. Although, if I were in her situation, almost a prisoner, as well-chaperoned women were at that time, I would have been just as miserable and passive, since women had few alternatives then. These lovers loose a chance to be together long-term, because they don't have enough self-control and discretion. It's possible that the book gets better later on; I just couldn't stand it any longer.
NEGATIVE	i am a fan of bix music so i was expecting a much better movie.however this flim jumps confusily around in time. alot of fictional stuff is added.plus the actor cast to play bix does not look anything like the real bix did. my someday a bix movie can be made that protrays him much better.
NEGATIVE	I must be crazy but how can anyone romanticize rape? William raped a defensive cripple girl repeatedly and she falls madly in love with him. Maybe there is a rape fattish out there but I just could not enjoy or understand this book. As a matter of fact I've started to see 2 trends in the Writers books so far that I've read. One is rape and the other is 2 men sharing a woman. Too Crazy and Too Weird!
NEGATIVE	I used to have the original Bissell Littel Green model for some time until it started to leak on me. Worked for about ~6months until I got fed up with it. It was really handy and worked real good at cleaning pet mess-ups. After it started to leak I purchased this one for ~$32.00. Worked great the first time, left it on the kitchen floor...saw a small water stain on the floor. Used it one more time, the next day...then it turned into a friggin water sprinkler and spilled everything it had on the floor slowly. I read the reviews before I bought it, thinking it were flukes...but this is why they sell so cheap. But hey, it has a 90-day warranty. That just means I'll get another leaky vacuum.So I'm better off swapping it for a new one at Wally World. :) They should either discontinue making this POS, recall, or give customers their money back, what a waste!
NEGATIVE	As the previous reviews pointed out, most of these are not the original recordings and definitely not worth the money. I would give it 0 stars if I could.
POSITIVE	"Anne Margaret Lewis' ""Has Anyone Seen Christmas?"" is sure to be Holiday Classic. Vibrant color schemes and a clever refrain make this a joy to read, and reread. Children will delight in trying to find Christmas with Emit, as well as enjoy seeing all the other holidays together. Popko's illustrations are timeless and children will enjoy spending time just devouring her pictures, studying each holiday, and trying to find each holiday on the pages as the story progresses. What makes this book a true treasure is, not only is it highly entertaining it delivers a nice message with out being too noticeable in doing so. This is a holiday keepsake."
POSITIVE	I am very pleased with this cabinet. I ordered a covered litter box that fits inside just right, using the measurements someone else listed in their review. I actually ordered the covered version of the litter box in a photo someone posted. They show the litter box with the shield but the same company makes a litter box with a lid(I bought the one without the flip top lid because of the reviews). The color is darker than pictured. What I received has more of a mahogany finish, but I think it looks better than the cabinet pictured! It is worth the money. I did not line the bottom of the cabinet, as others who reviewed suggested, because the litter box is covered, so I cannot comment on how it holds up if the cat misses inside. The cat loves it, too!
NEGATIVE	"His ""guide"" to intelligent design is filled with specious criticism of evolutionary biology yet utterly devoid any information on what exactly constitutes ""design"". A feeble effort."
POSITIVE	It is wonderful experience to explore the nooks and crannies of this antique Edwardian house. One of my favorite books from childhood because it allowed me to use my own imagination to create my own characters with the paper doll family which comes along in nifty pockets on the inside cover. Experiencing this book was comparable to playing with my very own dollhouse, but it included extra details, such as the mouse's tail sticking out of a pantry, which made Annabel's House a mystical and spendid place to be. The colorful and detailed illustrations are what make this book so special and wonderful gift for children of all ages, as long as they have an imagination.
POSITIVE	"Cats or dogs - dogs for sure, or so I would have said.I live in an area where there are many wild cats and over the past couple of years a few have made our home - their home. Although a dog person I do enjoy watching animals and when coming across this book and skimming the contents I was very much interested.It attempted to answer a lot of the crazy questions I was asking myself: ""why does it bring this rubbish back to us and present it as a gift?"", ""why does that little animal appear to be eating grass?"", ""why are its pupils vertical?"", and so on.I have always enjoyed how Morris explains things and was not disappointed here. Now - we have semi-adopted one cat and watch him more than before, sometimes with book in hand. Fun read more illustrations/images would be nice."
POSITIVE	"""A"" is for ""Awesome."" That's an appropriate word to use when describing this movie. I thought it was just too freakin' awesome. I give it a nice, big, fat juicy A-plus-plus."
POSITIVE	I bought this yesterday on the recommendation of the girl working in the paint department and I absolutely love it. You do need a very steady hand while working with this tool and need to be careful to not use to much paint but it makes a huge difference. I did not have to tape off anything and was able to create a nice clean edge while painting. You may want to read some more indepth reviews on similar items to get a clear idea on how to use this properly. It does work like a charm and I will never use tape again.
POSITIVE	One of the best inventions ever made. Works great. Bought it to use in miniature village. Works for everything. Definitely recommend this.
POSITIVE	I have a 'vertical' square Brinkman Smoker and I haven't been able to get the temperature up to 250 degrees. One of my web searches suggested cutting holes in the charcoal pan for more air OR getting a vegetable grill pan. I thought this Wok Pan might work. I received it today and it is AWESOME. It is quite heavy and well made! The 'handles' on this Wok-Topper slide in where the other charcoal pan goes for a perfect fit!..and it will hold plenty of charcoal. It is going to give the charcoal much more ventilation which will increase the temperature of my smoker. If I wasn't using this Wok-Pan for my smoker, I would still be thrilled with the QUALITY of this pan for grilling vegetables, etc. Outstanding price on this quality, heavy, well made pan.
POSITIVE	This book is wonderfully illustrated! It gives the perfect amount of information in an interesting format for children. I enjoy reading it to my children.
NEGATIVE	Just because a hulking monster with writhing tentacles out of it mouth appears for 3 seconds you can't call this Lovecraft. This is an awful movie. It tries to be psychological by constantly bombarding the view with shaky images of bloody stuff. The movie steals all the clichés of Asylum movies and throws in a few scenes where high school level acting is attempted. If you want a better Lovecraftian adaptation, check out the movie Dagon. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Oh. . .one more thing the special effects guy should study a bit more anatomy the gross scenes would be more scary and realistic.
NEGATIVE	"This is a nice machine except for the fact that when it is plugged it gives an electric shock to the user. Please search your favorite engine with ""sony vaio sz electrick shock"" and you will see that this is a common event. In the next month or so I will try to see if this machine can be returned to Sony and/or file a complaint with my state's attorney general. This is completely unnaceptable."
POSITIVE	My husband loves his new slippers, because they're super cozy and very warm. They're really well made. I'd recommend these to anyone.
POSITIVE	I recommend this book to philosophy students who study philosophical logic and wish to get into mathematical logic. The system of natural deduction he uses is not explained in much detail, but as long as you have learned at least one system of natural deduction and perhaps even the tree method of proof, you should be fine. His definitions and explanations of terms and of how one develops logical rules are excellent and explained very well. There is also a treatment of informal proof methods that mathematicians use, a section on basic set theory, and a section on axiomatizing scientific theories--the latter hinting at some of Suppes' own philosophical ideas.
NEGATIVE	...so don't waste your time reading this. I see Palahniuk's point in this book, but his execution is forced and at times boring. His writing style tries to come off as cute or witty, but his attempt at sidebar Vonnegut tangents fails miserably. This was my first book I read by him, and it really turned me off to his other works.
NEGATIVE	The worst is that after you finish the tests, you only got the range of the results. You will never got to know the correct answer. No answer, no explanation. How worst it is!Don't buy it!
NEGATIVE	"Well researched and very readable, McCullough has produced the best biography of Truman yet published. McCullough's narrative is rarely critical of Truman's actions, but he's such a great story teller that you hardly notice. For readable biographies, this book is second only to Robert K. Massie's ""Peter the Great."""
POSITIVE	"How can adults cover every lesson each child needs through life? Start with this series, ""Book of Virtues."" My niece and nephew are 4 & 7 and love them. They are truly terrific videos with loving, calming messages. Their parents prefer this to ""Sponge-Bob"", etc. & the kids always request their 'learning stories.'"
NEGATIVE	Since the very first day, this toaster burns toast(regardeless of the level)...Must stand and wait for the toast and guess when to push up the handle...toasts one side black while barely affecting the opposite side...
NEGATIVE	The numbers in the display didn't all work correctly, so the item was returned for a full refund. I purchased Weathertech model FX5000, which has more features and a larger display. It works great.
POSITIVE	The CD itself works fine, and it's not scratched or anything, but the CD cover has two cracks on it. I ordered it new, and it even had the plastic covering but it managed to crack. But other then that, it was good. It came in really early, too!
NEGATIVE	Dyson DC16 Root 6 Handheld Vacuum CleanerI am extremely disappointed with this product. I had heard so much about Dysons that when I needed a handheld, it was the only one I would consider. The problem is that the battery, fully-charged, only runs for 5 minutes. I never get to finish a project- whether it's my car, kitchen, steps, etc - before the battery runs out. Not worth this kind of money AT ALL!
NEGATIVE	Hey, what is wrong here. Am I the only one that thought that this movie made me a little less intelligent when walking out. This was a special effects movie where the effects were not that special. As for acting, was there any? Does Arnold even speak English? His voice needs to be dubbed like in the good old days. The end was the only enjoyable part because this was where I was set free at last. This was over two hours of my life that I will never get back.
NEGATIVE	"I was very disappointed in the content of this book. I was expecting meat and only got a strip of bacon. I already knew all the fluff stated in the book. I was looking for How to set up vendor relationships?, How can I ""hold"" a suit for my client to 'try on' without having to make a purchase for a couple of days while my client makes a decision? Instead I read 20 of the same statements over and over again (I got the feeling they needed to meet a page quota). Bottom-line: If you are really ""green"" and don't expect executable information, this book is for you. If you already have your office established and have a couple of clients, but no idea how to set up vendor relationships and what/how to charge, then I suggest you learn by trial and error, then write your own book...I will. But please, put some meat in it."
POSITIVE	Two words.HAUNTINLY BEAUTIFUL!I heard this the first time and cried, it moves you.I have shared it with several of my friends, and they, like me, thought they only loved rock and roll. LOL...One of my all time favorites. BEYOND AMAZING.
POSITIVE	Depending on the use you would give to the radios they are very functional and cool to use. I use them with my informatic team and we work in a four stories building. Great reception in about 4 kilometers. Great accesory!
POSITIVE	I have thick hair, and have been cutting it myself, with store-bought clippers, for years. During a recent use, my clipper choked on the thick hair, and I decided to get a professional clipper, so I bought the Oster Classic 76.What a difference! As you might expect based on the price, the Oster is in a class above when compared to the clipper kits you buy at the local Rite-Aid or WalMart. It's a quality appliance and seems to be well worth the extra expense for regular clipper users.So, why 4 stars instead of 5? Two reasons. One, it doesn't come with the numbered plastic combs--you have to purchase them separately. Second, it's on the heavy side and it's a bit cumbersome to use compared to the lighter, cheaper models. I suppose that's the price you pay for quality.
NEGATIVE	Don't buy this tool. It is cheap and hardly worth the effort to purchase it especially since the shipping is so ridiculous for this. Buy something of higher quality. Mine broke on the first use.
NEGATIVE	This book probably has 15 sentences and 15 pages. Each sentence saying that this or that poops.The first time you read it (I should say SEE it) you'll really laugh no matter how mature you are. But after, it'll be left under a bed. Good as a joke present, especially for those low budget exchange gifts. Now isn't poop talking fun !
POSITIVE	Half Baked is my bible. I watch Half baked every night three times before I can actually fall asleep. I want to be like Brian, and i feel that I can relate to him because I too have smelly feet. This movie will last forever, and my children, and there children will also live by the laws of Half Baked.
POSITIVE	If you need to increase your practical, working Hebrew vocabulary in a hurry, this book is your logical tool. Even after I have finished studying each day's page, my memory continues associating each picture with its Hebrew name right on top of it. Throughout the day,I can easily recall each Hebrew word on its item learned that morning, plus those of previous mornings' study. This is much faster assimilation than just memorizing lists of vocabulary words. Am grateful to own and use this simple, effective tool, but, will give it only four stars due to a serious handicap: it lacks both syllable breaks and accent marks. Nevertheless, it remains a worthy investment.
POSITIVE	I was initially unsure about this mount. I had my doubts about the design and whether it would be made out of quality materials. I was very happy to find that when I opened the box I got a quality mount. It is strong and works very well. The only thing I would suggest would be to MAKE SURE you have a stud directly behind the Telly. If you do not it WILL show the mount when hung.
POSITIVE	Good old fashioned musical - Loved it as well as the story. Saw this years ago and was excited to see it again.
POSITIVE	Susan Senator offers us a unique opportunity to step into her life and understand what a family experiences when one of the members has autism. This book is a very open and candid view into the struggles, the disappointments and sometimes scary times, but much more than that it allows us to celebrate the successes and milestones her family reaches. While the author makes no claims as to why autism occurs or how to cure it she does offer practical and imaginative tips and suggestions that helped her family cope with the disorder and even at times allows her son Nat to break through his autistic barrier and shine.
NEGATIVE	Day Of The Dead is somewhat slower and not as effective as its precessor Dawn Of The Dead,but still delivers some gore from the great Tom Savani. I didn't like the pace of the movie and also the acting of the soldiers was really annoying,plus picture quality was below average and sound was anywhere from blarring loud to soft. Lastly a group of researchers studying the behaviors on zombies and being ordered by the military trapped underground in missile silo just gets boring and looses its touch. Also the movie wastes to much time getting to the action and gore that would have kept the viewers attention.
POSITIVE	Product works great. A little more plastic than I would prefer but the resulted weight helps with ease of use. Price was a bit high.
NEGATIVE	This won't be much help to collectors. Many album titles listed in the discographies are wrong as well as release dates. I still pick it up from time to time just for a laugh and every time I do I find another error.
NEGATIVE	Yeah, the Guinevere point of view was different, but I passed throught this book idly, it kept dragging on and on; surprised I didn't doze off in the middle.I like these feminism books, where the females point of view is taken instead of the usual male ( Try THE FORESTWIFE by THERESA TOMLINSON, taken from Maid Marian's point of view instead of Robin Hoods. I found The Forestwife much more enjoyable. the foreign words and old English dialect, it felt like I was in their age and time, unlike this book).
NEGATIVE	I had seen this movie hoping there was a lot of Julie Strain. But to my disappointment her role ends after the starting minutes of the movie.... Rochelle swanson is fine but a disappointment for me overalll....
NEGATIVE	"After listening to ""Time to Say Goodbye"" many many times and, each time, coming away from the experience with tears in my eyes and joy in my heart from the profound experience of hearing this angel sing, I find it hard to believe that ""Eden"" is by the same artist. What a mismatched hodegpodge of music; limited range both vocally and instrumentally, and, to say the least, almost monotonous sounding. Not one single cut worth listening to more than the first time and most not even then. Sounded like someone reached into a ""grab-bag"" of singles and put the first 16 on the CD. Shame...shame."
NEGATIVE	If Mr. Harvey is such a learned scholar, why has he totally disregarded 8,000 years of Judeo-Christian theology, history and culture? Why has he warped the work of recent scholars? The answer is simple to promote his own groundless and perverted world view. I write this review in fear that some one may take this work to be a serious study of Christian theology. It isn't.
POSITIVE	only 7$ for this awesome cd?!? Excellent deal, has 24 great songs on it with bands such as Box Car Racer, The Used, Blink 182, Simple Plan, New Found Glory, Jimmy Eat World.
NEGATIVE	There aren't many fantasy books that I don't finish. The Knight is certainly imaginative, but I cannot seem to get into it due to the childish first person narrative. It is going to a library...
NEGATIVE	"Since I loved the PBS series ""Cranford,"" I wanted more. The series are supposed to be based on a couple of Gaskell's books, so I bought Cranford and this one. There was nothing of the TV series that came from ""North and South."" The book was pretty slow going at first, but since I loved Cranford, I stuck with it. I'm not sure that to enjoy the ending you really needed all of the little details. There is a family prominent to the story that added nothing and wasted a lot of pages, in my opinion. But I guess they are there to illustrate both sides of the economic life. It's not a book I would read again. But the ending made up for all the slogging through I had to do to get there. Now that I've read what I wrote, I'd have to say that it really wasn't worth all the time I spent reading it."
POSITIVE	If you want to try and learn Flash MX 2004 from scratch, go get this book. It will help you to get to intermediate level fast and with ease especially if you have a good knowledge in image editing. I guess, first few chapters will be too basic for you. You may just skip chapters that you think you're already armed with, just like what i did (skipping half of the book's pages), but with no regrets. After all, learning flash is what I'm after with. And besides, I haven't completed reading the book yet.My brother is learning the book also, but the difference is, he has no knowledge in image editing at all and he's really enjoying learning from the book. He has it 5 stars, I have it 4 stars by a few chapters. We're still trying to learn remaining chapters of the book that would determine the deciding factor.
POSITIVE	"This may be the best book about sportscasting since Red Barber's ""Rubarb in the Catbird's Seat."" Lindsey Nelson was the top sportscaster in the country during the late 50's and into the early 60's. He was the first well-known TV play-by-play man but he spanned back into the radio days and writes about the radio guys like Ted Husing, Bill Stern and Mel Allen. It's basically the life of a sports announcer at the top of the profession. He also writes about his WW 2 experiences and getting started in radio in Knoxville, Tennessee. He also writes eloquently about his daughter who was born with a mental handicap, the early death of his wife and his love of travel...he once went to Timbuktu. One of the best things about the book is he wrote it himself...no ghost writer."
